Difficulty Settings.
There are five dif ficulty settings. Whene ver a new game on a random map begins,
a difficulty setting must be selected; N o rm a l is the default. Scenarios aut o m a t i c a l l y
include a difficulty setting det e rmined by the situation facing the play e r’s Gr e a t
Power in that scenario. When difficulty settings are selected by the play e r, each
s etting establishes a diff e rent relationship be t ween the st a rting potential of t h e
G reat Pow e rs played by humans com p a red to the potential of those Great Pow e rs
played by computer AI. P otential is controlled by varying diplomatic relationships,
commodities available in the w a rehouse, and the size of the armed f o rces at t h e
start of the game.
Introductory Setting.
Minis ter advice, warnings, and briefings are all active. You do not select your own
c a p i t al city sites, and all your f a c to r ies and mills are cons t ru c t ed in advance. In
addition, all milit a ry units have been told to D e f e n d . Thus, you are not r e qu i r ed to
g i ve ord e rs to the milit a ry at the st a rt of the game. F i n a l l y, you and any ot h e r
human play e rs in the game r e c e i v e adv a n ta g es over the AI in economic and
diplomatic fields. 
Economic adv a n ta g es include the number of mineral r e s o u r ces lik e ly to be f o u n d
in your country and the amount of commodities (r e s o u r ces, mat e rials, and goods)
in your warehouse at the start of the game.
Diplomatic adv a n ta g es include be t ter relationships with certain of the Minor
Nations. This provides you with a head start in trade and diplomacy.
Easy Setting.
This setting includes most of the effects provided by the I n t ro d u c t o r ys etting. One
d i ffe rence is that the Minister Briefings do not aut o m a t i c a l l y appear. If you want to
read a br i e fing you must access it t h rough the help and inf o rmation dialog by
clicking on the Helpbutton. The diplomatic advantages pr ovided by the Introductor y
s etting are not included on the E a s y s etting, but the economic adv a n ta g es are
included.
Normal Setting.
You establish your own capital city’s site on the N o rm a l s etting. This provides more
c o n t r ol over the r e s o u r ces available at the st a rt of the game. In addition, y o u
decide which f a c to r ies and mills to cons t ruct on your f i rst turn given the limit e d
commodities available in your warehouse. 
None of the Great Powers have any special advantages on this setting.
Hard Setting.
As on the N o rm a l s etting, you establish your own capital city’s site and decide 
w h i c h fa c to r ies and mills to cons t ruct on your f i rst turn given the limit e d
commodities available. 
You are faced by computer pla yers with bo th economic and diplomatic advantages
similar to those given humans on the Introductory setting.IMPERIALISM: Starting a Game 5
--- page 10 ---
“Nigh-On Impossible” Setting.
As with the N o rm a l s etting, you establish your own capital city site and decide 
w h i c h fa c to r ies and mills to cons t ruct on your f i rst turn given the limit e d
commodities available. 
You are faced by computer pla yers with bo th economic and diplomatic advantages
similar to those given humans on the Introductor ysetting. Additionall y, the AI enjo ys
a large milit a ry super i o rity over any human bold (or foolish) enough to play on
this setting.
Preferences.
To set pr e fe rences, click on the Game Contr o l sb u t ton at the top right corner of t h e
Terrain Map screen. This button has a small computer icon on it. F rom the game
controls screen, click on the Set Preferences button.

HOW TO GET HELP
On all game screens where you make decisions, a Helpbutton appears in the upper -
right of the screen. 
On the Te rrain Map s c reen or one of the Or d e rs screens, click on this button to
b ring up the Help and Inf o rm a t i o n dialog. This dialog provides sev e ral op t i o n s
including advice or a Briefing from one of your Minis ters, r eviews of trade, battles,
news, and a status comparison of the Great Powers. 
On other screens some of these options are not available. When you click the H e l p
b u t ton you jump dir e c t ly to Minister Advice or Br i e fings for the screen you are on.
The other control common to almost all screens is the L e ft Arrow s y m b o l .
Clicking on this control closes the current screen. During a turn it re t u rns you 
to the Te rrain Map . During the transition be t ween turns it advances you to 
the next screen
Minister Briefings.
If you play with the Br i e fings pr e fe rence on, you r e c e i v e Minister Briefings at th e
beginning of your turn on each game screen. The br i e fings provide basic
information on several topics for each new screen.
Additional br i e fings are provided for more com p l ex screens, but you r e c e i v e only
one br i e fing each turn until all the br i e fings for that screen are issued. You can access
p a st bri e fings using the P revious Briefing h i g h l i g h t ed text on the br i e fings dialog.
Using the Briefings.
In each briefing dialog you see the title of the briefing and a list of blue underlined
topics. Click on a topic, and the list of topics is replaced by text about the t o p i c
you selected. Once you ha ve read all the information, click on Show Topics again t o
return to the selection of topics for the briefing.
When you are learning to play, the br i e fings are best used by reading about one
activity or inter face and then putting the briefing aside while you try out what you
have just read. Since the briefings are floating windo ws, you can lea ve the windo w
open, do some thing on the screen, and then r eturn to the briefing to read about a
d i ffe rent activity. If you close the br i e fing window, you can easily bring it back by
clicking on the Helpbutton.
The f i rst topic on a br i e fing window provides an introduction and g e n e ra l
i n fo r mation about the screen. The second topic often provides a more det a i l e d
look at the items displayed on the screen. The t h i rd topic usually pro v i d e s
i n st r uctions on giving or d e rs. The last two topics, if available, offer tips for g a m e
p l ay on the screen. Sometimes one or more of these topics are not pr e s e n t ; fo r
example, if no orders can be given, there is no “Giving Orders” topic.IMPERIALISM: How to Get Help 7

Warnings from Ministers.
When one of your Minist e rs believes your or d e rs may lead to unf o rt u n a t e re s u l t s ,
he provides a w a rning. A dialog including your countr y ’s coat of arms and a
picture of the Minis ter appears o ver the screen. The Minis ter explains the situation
and often provides sugg e sted c h a n g es to your or d e rs. You can always choose to
ignore the warning; af ter all, you rule the Great P ower. In fact, on the Preferences
screen you can disable many of the warnings entirely.
S o m e times the Minist e rs do not know all the facts of the situation. For ex a mp l e ,
your Int e rior Minister may r e p o r t that your tr a n s p o r t ord e rs are going to lead to
sta rvation of indus t rial w o rke rs. You may know that your f o reign trade is going to
bring in canned food to deal with the situation. It might be a mis take to follow the
Minister’s suggestions blindly. 
The most dire warnings in volve the saf ety of the capital. If you lose the capital you
lose the game.
The Help and Information Dialog.
For help click on the H e l p b u t ton from Or d e rs screens and the Te rrain Map
s c reen. The Help b u t ton is found in the upper right of the screen. The Help and
Information dialog which pops up provides several options for obtaining help.
Advice from Minis ters.
Your t h ree Minist e rs (Defence, Int e ri o r , and F o reign) have a lot to say. You can
ask them for help by clicking the A d v i c e b u t ton in the Help and Inf o rm a t i o n
dialog, which brings up the br i e fing window. Each Minister is also responsible f o r
popping up to w a rn you about issues within that Minist e r’s por t folio that may
require your attention. 
Reading the News.
The newspaper appears at the st a rt of ev e ry turn. Click on the N e w s p a p e r b u t to n
on the Help and Inf o rm a t i o n dialog to re v i ew headlines for this turn. Gener a l ly,
a story that of fers information, pr ovides a warning, or af fects the play of the game
a p p e a r s under a bold headline. Of course, as a wise ruler you should become
a c qu a i n t ed with all the new s wo r thy doings of the little people who make up y o u r
country’s population.
Battle Reports.
You r e c e i v e a battle r e p o r t after you end the turn in which a battle t a kes place.
O ften, especially in a multiplayer game, you are not going to have enough time
b et w een turns to re v i ew all the details in the r e p o r t. If you want to look at t h e

IMPERIALISM BASICS
IM P E R I A L I S M is a turn-based game in which you rule one of the w o rl d ’ s Gr e a t
Powe rs. Each new turn begins with a newspaper summarising the key events of
the past three months. 
Once you have read the new s p a p e r , you go to the Te rrain Map s c reen, y o u r
c e n t r al command centre. During your turn you command your milit a ry and
civilian units, f a c to r ies, tr a d e r s, diplomats, and w a rships as do the r u l e rs of t h e
other Great P owers. The rulers of each Great P ower, be they a human pla yer or a
computer player, enter their orders simultaneously.
When all r u l e rs have ended their turns, the commands ent e red by each Gr e a t
Power during that turn are car ried out simultaneousl y. Each turn represents three
months. Most games consist of about 400 turns, though, of course, one pla yer ma y
win before this time.
How to Rule Your Empire.
You gov e rn your Em p i re using f i ve screens: a central Te rrain Map s c reen and
four Orders screens accessed from the T errain Map.
Introduction to the Ter rain Map Screen.
The Te rrain Map s c reen is your command centre and consists of a map of t h e
world and a toolbar. Each turn begins and ends on the Terrain Map screen. Her e
you access game controls to save your game or st a rt a new one, set g a m e
preferences, and manage all your military and civilian units. For de tails on how t o
use the Terrain Map screen see the “What Happens on the Ter rain Map” section,
starting on page 18. 
Introduction to the Orders Screens.
From the Te rrain Map s c reen you access four O rd e r ss c reens called t h e
Tra n s p o r t, I n d u st r y, Bid and Off e rs, and D i p l o m a c y s c reens. You need not use
all these screens ev e ry turn; you may find y o u rself spending more time on I n d u st r y,
for ex a mple, than you do on D i p l o m a c y . Your ov e rall st ra tegy for winning t h e
game det e rmines which of these O rd e r ss c reens you need to use the mos t .
Transport Screen.
This is where you order commodities to be moved from the r u ral and
mining dis t ricts of t e rri to ries you rule to the indus t rial centres where t h e
commodities can be used. Each turn, when you click the End T u rnb u t to n
on the Te rrain Map s c reen , the commodities you or d e red tr a n s p o r ted move to
the w a rehouse in the I n d u st r ys c reen for use during the next turn. For more
information see the “Transport Network” section, starting on page 44. IMPERIALISM: IMPERIALISM Basics 11
CONTENTS
--- page 16 ---
Industry Screen.
This is where commodities you tr a n s p o r t and commodities you trade f o r
are used to produce more expensive or useful commodities. You also build
all your units on this screen. Each turn, when you click the End Tur nbutton
on the Te rrain Map s c reen, all the production or d e rs you ent e red on this scr e e n
a re carried out. The things you build are available next turn. For more
information see the “Industry” section, starting on page 50. 
Bid and Of fers Screen.
This is where you offer commodities for sale and enter bids f o r
commodities you hope to buy. Each turn, when you click the End T u rn
button on the Terrain Map screen, you may receive of fers to buy some or
all of the items you bid on. The items you off e red for sale may be sold to ot h e r
c o u n t r ies. If you accept an offer to buy, the commodities you bought appear f o r
your use on the I n d u st r ys c reen during your next turn. Commodities you sell are
d e d u c t ed from the w a rehouse on the I n d u st r ys c reen. For more inf o rmation see
the “Trade” section, starting on page 61.
Diplomacy Screen.
This is where you view information about the o ther countries in the game,
declare war, take diplomatic initiatives, set trade policies, and g rant foreign
aid. Each turn, when you click the End T u rnb u t ton on the Te rrain Map
s c reen, the policies you set are carried out. If you off e red a treaty to anot h e r
c o u n t r y, its ruler accepts or rejects your off e r. If another country off e red you a
treaty or pact, you act on it. Any changes in diplomatic s tatus take ef fect next turn.
For more information see the “Diplomacy” section, starting on page 71. 
Order of Actions Within a Turn.
When all Great Pow e rs have ended their turns the series of commands are always
carried out in the same order: 
• Diplomatic offers are exchanged, and either accepted or rejected.
• Trade deals are offered, and accepted, or rejected.
• Industrial production takes place.
• Military conflicts are resolved.
• Intercepted or blockaded trades are cancelled. 
• All commodities tr a n s p o r ted int e rn a l l y, or successfully deliv e red by tr a d e r s, are  
placed in the industrial warehouse for use on the next turn.
Cancelling Orders.
On the Te rrain Map s c reen the End T u rnb u t ton appears in the lower right. U n t i l
you click this button, you can cancel any of the or d e rs you have ent e red. Not h i n g
is permanent until you click the End Turn button.IMPERIALISM: IMPERIALISM Basics 12

Countries in Imperialism.
In I M P E R I A L I S M th e re are two types of countries. The f i rst type, Great Pow e rs, are
actors in the game, each ruled by a human or by a wily computer foe. The second
type, Minor Nations, serve as regions for e x p l o i t ation and battle by the Gr e a t
Powe rs. A Minor Nation in I M P E R I A L I S M c a n n o t develop into a Great Pow e r, nor
can it win the game. 
Both Minor Nations and Great P owers may be conquered by o ther Great P owers.
When part of a country is t a ken by conq u e st it becomes part of the conq u e ri n g
G reat Pow e r. The country that lost the land is smaller. Both Great Pow e rs and
Minor Nations can be eliminated from the game by conquest.
Minor Nations can be colonised by Great Pow e rs. In I M P E R I A L I S M , colonisation
refers to a “peaceful” takeo ver that could be the result of economic po wer over the
Minor Nation, br i b e ry of the Minor N a t i o n ’s leaders, or successful int e rve n t i o n
on behalf of the Minor Nation in a war st a rted by another Great Pow e r. Gre a t
Powers cannot be taken over by these means. 
In ra n d o m l y ge n e ra t ed w o rlds, t h e re are always seven Great Pow e rs and sixt e e n
Minor Nations. These numbers may be different if you choose to play a scenario.IMPERIALISM: IMPERIALISM Basics 13

Control of Pr ovinces.
A province is a political division of a Great Power or Minor Nation. All r a n d o m l y
ge n e ra t ed w o rlds include 120 provinces. Each Great Power st a rts the game with
eight provinces. Minor Nations have only f o u r. In scenarios, the number of
p rovinces in the w o rld and the number within a single country can v a ry. Ev e ry
province includes a capital city or a town.
Military conflict happens at the pr ovince le vel. This means that each pr ovince has
o n ly one owner at the end of a turn; provinces are fought over but may not be
divided. Each province counts as one space for milit a ry units. If anyone inv a d e s
the province, the regiments in the province defend it. 
Conquests.
C o n qu e r ed te rri to ry functions ex a c t ly like the t e rri to ry with which you st a rt th e
game; you may develop the t e rrain, build ports and depots, and station troops in
it. Re s o u r ces g a th e r ed at ports and depots in conq u e red te rri to ry appear in y o u r
transport network. 
All te rri to ry you conquer must be t a ken province by province. Although you can
e l i m i n a t e a country by taking the province containing its capitol, the r e m a i n i n g
te rri to ry of the country does not join you; instead it ent e rs into a st a te of anarchy.
P rovinces in a st a te of anarchy produce no r e s o u r ces, and regiments st a t i o n e d
th e re do not conduct att a c ks. Howev e r, these local f o rces defend t h e m s e l ves if t h e
province is invaded. 
No declaration of war is required to attack pr ovinces that are in a s tate of anar chy.
If you eliminate ano ther country by taking its capitol, o ther Great P owers may see
this as an opportunity to grab the remaining provinces without paying cos t ly
declaration of war penalties.
Colonies.
When your Great Power gains a colony, the entire Minor Nation, including all its
p rovinces, joins you at once. Howev e r, owning a Minor Nation colony is slightly
d i ffe rent than owning conq u e red te rri to ry. Colonies retain a small amount of
independence, and the owning Great Power must develop the r e s o u r ces of t h e
c o l o n y by purchasing land from the colony. For more inf o rmation see t h e
“Wo rking in Other Countries” section, st a rting on page 29. The r e s o u rc e s
p roduced by colonies are traded on the w o rld market and not added to y o u r
t ra n s p o r t net wo r k. As owner of the colony, your country enjoys a right of f i rst
refusal on these resources.IMPERIALISM: IMPERIALISM Basics 14

How to Win.
A l though it might be possible to conquer the entire w o rld, your Em p i re would be
u n b e a t able long bef o re the last enemy province fell. At a point when the w o rl d
recognises that one Great Power has attained a dominant position, the winner is
declared based on a vote by the world-wide Council of Governors .
Council of Go vernors.
A p p r ox i m a te l y eve ry ten y e a rs, each of the provinces in the w o rld brings one vote
to the Council of Gov e rn o r s. Whenever a Great Power assembles the support of
more than two-thirds of these provincial governors, that power wins the game.
Nominations.
The council f i rst nominates the two leading Pow e rs. Nominations r e flect t h e
diplomatic, industrial, and military might of the Great P owers. Even if you possess
the larg e st army among the Great Pow e rs, you may not r e c e i v e a nomination 
if the council considers your economy under d eveloped, or you have become a
diplomatic pariah. 
Voting.
Once two countries are selected as nominees for vict o ry, the provincial gov e rn o r s
vote. If your Great Power is nominated you aut o m a t i c a l l y re c e i v e the suppor t i n g
votes of the gov e rn o r s of provinces you own, whether as original t e rri to ry,
c o n qu e r ed land, or colonial possessions. Although at the beginning of the g a m e
m o st non-aligned gov e rn o r s abstain. As the game pr o gresses, the diplomatic,
m i l i ta r y, and economic accomplishments of the successful Great Pow e rs cause an
ever-increasing number of go vernors to of fer their support. Eventuall y, in the tent h
council meeting, all go vernors must select one nominee or the o ther. At this point,
if not earlier, one Great Power is declared the winner by a majority of votes. 
How the Economy Wor ks.
The success of the Great Pow e rs in I M P E R I A L I S M depends on the ability of t h e
ru l e rs to ov e rcome short a ges and limited supply. You usually find y o u rself with
i n s u f ficient money and insufficient commodities to do ev e ry thing you wish,
especially at the beginning of the game.
The Money Suppl y.
E a ch Great Power begins the game with a limited amount of cash which is tot a l ly
inadequate to meet its needs. There are three w ays to expand the cash a vailable t o
your Great Power. 
Fi rst, you must expand the trading might of your country. Ev e ry time you sell
commodities to other countries you receive a cash payment for the sale.
Second, gold and gems are not traded. Instead, these commodities provide a cash
bonus to you whenever you transport them to industry. IMPERIALISM: IMPERIALISM Basics 15
CONTENTS
--- page 20 ---
Third, you can receive profits from the activities of your De veloper unit and o ther
civilian units in those Minor Nations where you have established embassies.
It is dif ficult to be successful as an isolationist in IMPERIALISM . There is no income
f rom t a xation; int e rnational commerce is the only way to build a subst a n t i a l
treasury. 
Classification and Value of Commodities.
All commodities in the game are classified as resources, materials, or goods. 
Resources.
Re s o u r ces are commodities that are grown, such as liv e stock; or mined, such as
coal. R e s o u r ces g e n e ra l l y are the most common and least valued commodities.
The r e s o u r ces class includes: grain, liv e sto c k, fruit, fish, co t ton, wool, hor s e s ,
timber, coal, iron ore, oil, gold, and gems.
Materials.
Materials are basic building blocks of production, created directly using a resource
or re s o u r ces. Mat e rials usually have a mid-r a n ge value and are used to cons t ru c t
m o st units, f a c to r ies, mills, and tr a n s p o r t capacity. Mat e rials are also used to
p roduce goods. The mat e rials class includes canned food, f a b ric, paper, lumber,
steel, and fuel.
Goods.
Goods are the highest level and most e x p e n s i v e of the commodities. Three of t h e
four goods in IMPERIALISM , clothing, furniture, and hardware, are called consumer
goods. Their chief usefulness is as items to sell to other countries to make money.
Fu rn i t u r e and clothing also help you encour a ge migration to indus t ry. Un l i ke
m a te r ials, consumer goods are not used to expand your economy or cons t ru c t
units. The f o u rth type, armaments, can be sold like the consumer goods, and are
required for the construction of military and naval units.IMPERIALISM: IMPERIALISM Basics 16

If you play on the N o rm a l , H a rd, or N i g h - O n - I m p o s s i b l e s ettings, you build your o w n
c a p i t al city upon st a rting a new game. The capital must be cons t ru c t ed on f l a t
te rrain with access to w a te r. Your Minister w a rns you if you try to build on an
i l l e gal tile. While choosing a site f o r, and cons t ructing, your capital city, scr o l l i n g
is limited to spaces over your own country.
When a tile is selected for your capital city, a dialog which sa ys: Local food can sustain
nhealthy population ( xm a x i m u m ) . The higher the number of population your capit a l
can support the be t te r. See the “Food Consumption” section, st a rting on page 55
for more information.
G e n e ra l l y, you should search for a tile near plentiful food with access to timber,
wool, or co t ton to assist your early development. Capitals built on a r i ver in a
province with no coastline are much safer from seaborne invasions.
The Map.
The map provides a view of the entire w o rld. You scroll by moving the mouse
c u rsor to the edge of the screen. Holding down the C o n t ro l key and clicking on
the map centres the screen where you clicked. On r a n d o m l y cre a ted w o rlds y o u
m ay scroll around the w o rld to the east or w e st, but you are blocked in the Ar c t i c
and Ant a rctic regions. For most scenarios, the w o rld is r e c ta n g u l a r ; you cannot
scroll off the map edge.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 18

Borders.
Countries are divided from each o ther either by sea, or by a wide, coloured border
if two countries appear on the same land mass. These bor d e rs include the colour
of each country on that country’s side of the border.
W h i t e lines be t ween fr i e n d l y provinces r e p resent provincial bor d e rs. Bor d e rs in
the sea divide the sea zones from each other.
Terrain Tiles.
Although for military units a pr ovince is considered one space, for the purposes of
building and development, which are the realms of civilian units, a province is
divided into t e rrain tiles. Each t e rrain tile is a space for a civilian unit to w o rk in.
E n g i n e e r s and Dev e l o p e r s, with the necessary t e ch n o l o g y , may w o rk in most
terrain tiles. Other civilian workers function only in certain types of terrain tiles.
I n fo–click on any t e rrain tile to find out what is in that tile. Note that the only
types of t e rrain that cannot be im p roved by a civilian w o rker are the dry plains,
the horse r a n ch, and the scrub f o re st. If a r i ver is present in any tile, that t e rra i n
tile can produce fish in addition to the commodities listed below.

Towns.
E a ch province contains one town, unless the capital of the country is
l o c a t ed th e re instead. Towns supply no r e s o u r ces at the beginning of
the game. Only the Engineer can work in the t own. Later, t owns begin
to produce industrial commodities like steel or lumber.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 19

Capital Cities.
C a p i t als produce r e s o u r ces depending on their location; for inst a n c e ,
if set in the f o re st, a capital produces timber. Only the Engineer may
wo rk on a capital t e rrain tile, but since the capital tile aut o m a t i c a l l y
p roduce r e s o u r ces at the highest possible level (depending on
technology), the other civilian units are not needed there. 
Rivers and Coasts.
R i ve r s wind from mountain t e rrain tiles to the sea coast, passing t h rough ot h e r
te rrain along the way. W i th two ex c e ptions, a tile with a r i ver is identical to a tile
w i thout one. The f i rst ex c e ption is that an Engineer may cons t ruct a port on a
ri ver tile, the second ex c e ption is that r i ve rs, like coasts, produce one unit of f i s h
per turn for adjacent ports.
Sea Zones.
The w o rl d ’ s oceans are divided into Sea Zones just as the land is divided into
p rovinces. In most respects, sea zones function for naval conflict in the same way
that provinces w o rk for land battles. Howev e r, the sea is a big place, and it is
possible for more than one f l e et, even hostile f l e ets, to occupy the same sea zone at
the same time. This means that sea zones do not have an owner as provinces do,
a l though a f l e et in undisputed occupation of a zone controls that sea zone for some
game purposes such as cutting off ports from the tr a n s p o r t net wo r k. For more
i n fo r mation see the “How Connections Are Lost” section, st a rting on page 45.
Terrain Map Screen Toolbar .
The buttons of the toolbar c h a n g e slightly depending on the type of unit (na v y,
a rmy, or civilian) curr e n t ly selected. The buttons which are used to give or d e rs to
units and the central display area on the toolbar are discussed in the “T oolbar f o r
C i v i l i a n s , ” “Toolbar for R e g i m e n t s , ” and “Toolbar for Fleets” sections on pag e s
24, 36, and 40, respectivel y. The rest of the buttons supply game functions and ar e
always available on this screen. 
The Top Buttons.
At the top of the toolbar you see four buttons: Z o o m , Invest in T e c h n o l o g y , G a m e
Controls , and Helpbutton .
The Zoom Button.
The Z o o m b u t ton, which appears as a magnifying glass, controls the zoom
l evel of the t e rrain map. The default view is nor m a l l y best, but when you 
a re moving f l e ets or civilian units long distances, it can be useful to zoom out. 
The In vest in Technology Button.
The Invest in Technology button, which appears as a microscope, takes you t o
the t e chnology inv e stment screen. This button appears lighter than t h e
surrounding wood when there is a new technology to invest in.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 20

The Game Controls Button.
The Game Contr o l sb u t ton appears as a com p u te r . Click here to bring up
the Game Controls dialog which allo ws you to sa ve, load, quit, and s tart a

The Help Button.
The H e l p b u t ton is available on the Te rrain Map s c reen and on many of
the other screens in the game, including all four O rd e r ss c reens. Clicking
on this button accesses the Help and Inf o rm a t i o n dialog. For more

Mini–Map.
When you look at a Mini-Map, you see in miniature appro x i m a te l y one-q u a rte r
of the w o rld. The Mini-Map shows political and milit a ry control over t h e
continents, but does not show any t e rrain. It provides the easiest method f o r

The End Turn Button.
The End Tur nbutton appears only on the Terrain Map screen at the bottom of the
to o l b a r . When you click here, you are committed. No or d e rs can be cancelled or
changed once you end your turn. 
The Cycle of Units.
The Te rrain Map s c reen provides a method for commanding all your units:
civilian, milit a ry, and naval. Available units are selected for you one by one and
s h own both on the map and in the t o o l b a r . As each unit appears, you have t h e
opportunity to give it new orders. This process is called the units cycle.
The selected unit (or units in the case of f l e ets and g a rrisons) has a flashing white
outline on the Te rrain Map . In the toolbar you see a picture of the unit or units
you could curr e n t ly command. On the map, army units are grouped into
ga rrisons, naval units are grouped into f l e ets. When a g a rrison or f l e et is select e d ,
the toolbar br e a ks down the g a rrison or f l e et into its component parts, sho w i n g
the individual units in the group.
As the units cycle each turn, you may give or d e rs using the toolbar buttons or by
clicking dir e c t ly on the map. Units that r e c e i v e ord e rs that t a ke more than one
t u rn to finish do not appear in the cycle while t h ey are still w o rking. Of cour s e ,
you can seek them out, observe their actions, and, if you wish, cancel or c h a n g e
their orders. When a unit finishes its job, it returns to the cycle automatically.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 21

Command Cursors.
Command cur s o rs are used when a unit, g a rrison, or f l e et is already selected. As
you move your mouse across the t e rrain map, the cursor c h a n g es to inf o rm yo u

Selection Cursors.
These cur s o rs are used to select a new unit — either when another unit is alr e a d y
selected or when no unit is selected. By clicking on the unit indicated by the cursor ,
you select that unit indicated by a flashing white outline. Since t h e re is an

these selection cursors only when you want to command units in a dif ferent order ,
or when you have previously removed a unit from the cycle.

Civilian Units.
Civilian units develop and im p rove land on the Te rrain Map s c reen. None of t h e
civilians have any ability to attack or even defend t h e m s e l ves. If present in a
province when the province is lost, the civilian is automatically killed. 
All civilians, with the ex c e ption of the Dev e l o p e r , are cons t ru c t ed using an e x p e r t
wo rke r, paper, and cash on the I n d u st r ys c reen in the U n i ve rs i t y . Once or d e re d
in the University, civilians appear on the Terrain Map at the s tart of the next turn.
For instructions on how to construct civilians see the “University” section, s tarting
on page 55. IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 23
CONTENTS
--- page 28 ---
All civilians may move any distance each turn. Howev e r, th ey cannot enter land
controlled by o ther Great P owers; nor can they deploy to Minor Nations until you
e stablish an Embassy t h e re. They can always deploy to land you own by right of
conquest or colonisation.
Toolbar for Civilians.
For the most part you command your civilians on the t e rrain map using the 
map cur s o rs. Howev e r, four toolbar buttons can be used whenever a civilian is
s e l e c t ed. These buttons appear dir e c t ly above the picture of the selected civilian
unit on the toolbar.
The Disband Command.
The f i rst button on the left provides the option of disbanding the select e d
civilian and sending him back to industr y. Each civilian unit costs you one
ex p e r t indus t rial w o rker when built in the U n i ve rs i t y , so disbanding him
ret u rns him to indus t ry and gives you four more labour per turn for indus t ry. Yo u
do not r e c over the cost of cash and paper or i g i n a l l y spent to make the e x p e r t into
a civilian w o rke r. When you click this button you must conf i rm that you want to
disband the unit. Unlike most orders, you cannot take this order back.
The N ext Unit Command.
The second button, which appears as a small arrow pointing to the r i g h t
side of the screen, advances you from the curr e n t ly selected unit to t h e
n ext unit in your cycle. This w o rks for f l e ets and g a rrisons as well as f o r
civilian units. Use this button when you want to delay giving or d e rs to this unit
until later in the turn.
The Done Command.
The D o n e b u t ton, t h i rd in the row on the t o o l b a r , appears as a small X.
This command, if given to a selected unit, tells the unit to do nothing f o r
this turn only. The unit appears normally in the cycle next turn.
You might use this button when a civilian t e mp o ra ri l y has nothing to do, or when
you lack the cash to pay for the civilian’s im p rovements. Next turn, if
circumstances change, you can order the civilian at that time.
The Sleep Command.
LikeDone, the Sleep command ends the unit ’s turn. Ho wever, ordering the
civilian to sleep r e m oves it from the cycle of units for future turns as w e l l .
You might decide to give this order when a civilian has no thing to do for a
long time, but you expect to want him later.
Once the unit is sleeping, you must use the selection cursor to r e sto re the sleeping
unit to the cycle. Since you still see the sleeping unit on the T e rrain Map, it’s not
difficult to find him and click on him with this cursor. You can also use the Wake all
U n i t s key b o a r d shortcut, by pressing the  “ w ” key, to w a ke up all sleeping units
and return them to the cycle. IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 24

Work of Civilian Units.
All civilian units are used to develop the commodities available in t e rrain tiles.
Their functions include: finding commodities (Pr o s p e c t or), im p roving pr o d u c t i o n
l evels of commodities (F a rm e r , Miner, R a n ch e r , Fo re ste r, Driller), connecting
commodities to the tr a n s p o r t net wo r k (Engineer), and buying land in ot h e r
countries so the land can be developed (Developer).
The f o l l owing table shows how many units of a commodity can be e x t ra c t ed fr o m
one tile at each of four possible levels of development, with level 0 meaning t h e
l evel a tile st a rts at bef o re a civilian has im p roved it. The table also shows which
type of civilian unit improves the development level for that commodity.

Prospector .
M o st re s o u r ces on the T e rrain Map are aut o m a t i c a l l y revealed to you just
by looking at the type of t e rrain tile. For instance, you know that co t ton is
p resent at ev e ry cot ton plantation t e rrain tile. You need not search for it.
H oweve r, coal, iron, gold, gems, and oil must be found by a Pr o s p e c to r
before they can be exploited by your other civilians. 
Wi th a Pr o s p e c t or selected, an eye cursor lets you know if the tile under y o u r
c u rsor is eligible for the selected Pr o s p e c t or to search. Since the four minerals are
found only in barren hill and mountain tiles, the eye appears only over those tiles
at the beginning of the game. Lat e r, when your country inv e sts in Oil Dr i l l i n g
technology, the e ye cursor appears o ver unprospected swamps, deserts, and tundr a
as well. If a Pr o s p e c t or of your Great Power has already searched a tile, you see a
small pickaxe and a red “X” when the Prospector is selected. 
On the t o o l b a r , small t e rrain tiles under the inf o rmation about a select e d
P ro s p e c t or let you know how many t e rrain tiles are left to search in the country t h e
P ro s p e c t or is in. To find these remaining t e rrain tiles q u i c k l y, click on the small tiles
in the t o o l b a r , and the screen moves immediat e ly to the next un p ro s p e c t ed tile. 
Engineer .
The Engineer is the only civilian with multiple functions. His most
i mp o r tant duty is the cons t ruction of a tr a n s p o r t net wo r k that joins y o u r
i n d u st r y to the r e s o u r ces developed by all of your other civilian units on
the T e rrain Map. He can also increase the def e n s i v e capabilities of a
province by building forts.
When the Engineer is selected, two working cursors are a vailable. With the cursor
over tiles adjacent to the Engineer’s current location you see a small piece of
railroad track. Clicking on one of these adjacent tiles orders the Engineer to spend
the turn building a r a i l road line be t ween his present tile and the tile you click e d
on. Howev e r, you do not always have the t e chnology necessary to build rail into
certain terrain.
When you click on the tile where the Engineer is located, you see the ot h e r
wo rking cur s o r, a hammer. This or d e rs the Engineer to cons t ruct something in
that tile. A pop-up dialog lets you select the type of cons t ruction. Choices f o r
c o n st r uction include rail depots, ports, and f o rt i fications. Howev e r, some of t h e s e
m ay not be available in certain t e rrain tiles. More advanced cons t ru c t i o n
te chnology increases the number of types t e rrain where rails may be laid and
d e p o ts may be built. P o rts always r e qu i r e access to w a te r. Fo rt i f ications are built
throughout the province, not just the current tile.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 26

Miner .
M i n e r s cannot be used until a Pr o s p e c t or locates some gold, gems, coal,
or iron to mine. Once you have discov e red a mineral deposit and t h e
Miner is selected, you see a hammer cursor over the tile with unmined
m i n e r als. Clicking on that tile commands the Miner to w o rk th e re ,
opening a mine. Until a mine is built, the tile does not produce minerals. U n l e s s
your new mine is next to your capital, you must make sure that the mine is on or
w i thin one tile of a connected port or rail depot. Ot h e rwise, the mined r e s o u rc e s
are not reflected in your transport network. 
When a Miner finishes opening a new mine it produces at Level I. Lat e r,
once you ha ve invested in the technology for Square Set Timbering , your
Miner can re t u rn to this Level I mine and im p rove it to Level II.
E ve n t u a l l y, the t e chnology for D y n a m i t e m a kes Level III mining possible. Gold
and gems produce at the r a te of one unit per level of the mine. Coal and ir o n
mines produce at double this amount; so maximum coal or iron production is six
units per turn from a Level III mine.
Since all minerals are found in barren hills and mountains, these are the only
terrain tiles where Miners can work.
Farmer .
Fa rm e r s imp rove the output of f a rms, orc h a rds, and plantations. Ev e n
though dry plains do produce a f a rm product, grain, these tiles cannot be
i mp r oved. When a F a rmer is selected, you see a hammer cursor over all
tiles where im p rovements are possible with your present t e ch n o l o g i e s .
Clicking on a tile commands the F a rmer to w o rk imp roving the gro w th of co t to n ,
grain, or fruit in that tile. Unless this impr oved tile is next to your capital you mus t
m a ke sure that the tile is on or within one tile of a connected port or rail depo t .
Otherwise, the farmed resources are not reflected in your transport network. 
Un l i ke minerals, f a rmed r e s o u r ces produce one unit per turn at Level 0 (wit h o u t
a ny im p rovement by a F a rmer). The f i rst im p rovements made by a F a rmer r a i s e
p roduction to Level I (two units per turn). Lat e r, Level II and Level III become
possible with the in vestment in new technology. At the beginning of the game, the
fa rms and orc h a rds adjacent to your capital city are aut o m a t i c a l l y im p roved to
Level I, even before you build a farmer in the University.
Rancher .
Ra n ch e r s imp rove the output of liv e stock r a n ches on the plains, and t h e
growing of sheep in f e rtile hills. At the beginning of the game, y o u r
Un i ve r sity cannot build a R a n cher unit. R a n ch e r s are not available until
you invest in the technology of Feed Grasses .
When a R a n cher is selected, you see a hammer cursor over all tiles where
i mp r ovements are possible. Clicking on a tile commands the R a n cher to w o rk
i mp r oving the gro w th of wool or liv e stock in that tile. Unless this im p roved tile is
n ext to your capital you must make sure the tile is on or within one tile of a
c o n n e c t ed port or rail depot. Ot h e rwise, the r e s o u r ces are not r e fl e c t ed in y o u r
transport network.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 27
--- page 32 ---
L i ve s tock and wool are produced at Level 0 (one unit per turn) wit h o u t
a ny im p rovement by a R a n ch e r . The f i rst im p rovements made by a
Ra n cher raise production to Level I (two units per turn). Lat e r, Level II
and Level III become possible with the investment in new technology. 
Forester.
Fo re ste rs imp rove the output of timber in the har d wood f o re sts. Ev e n
though scrub forests do produce a minimal amount of timber, their output
cannot be impr oved. At the beginning of the game, your University canno t
build a Fores ter unit. He is not a vailable until you in vest in the technology
of Iron Railroad Bridges .
When a F o re ster is selected, you see a hammer cursor over all f o re st tiles where
i mp r ovements are possible. Clicking on a tile commands the F o re ster to w o rk
impr oving the output of timber in that tile. Unless this impr oved tile is next to your
capital you must make sure that the tile is on or within one tile of a connected por t
or rail depot. Otherwise, the resources are not reflected in your transport networ k.
Timber is produced at Level 0 (one unit per turn) without any
i mp r ovement by a F o re ste r. The f i rst im p rovements made by a F o re ste r
raise production to Level I (two units per turn). Lat e r, Level II and Lev e l
III become possible with the investment in new technology. 
Driller .
D ri l l e r s cannot be used until a Pr o s p e c t or locates some oil to drill. A
P ro s p e c t or cannot look for oil until you inv e st in Oil Dr i l l i n g te ch n o l o g y .
Once you have discov e red some oil and the Driller is selected, you see a
hammer cursor over the tile with undrilled oil. Clicking on that tile
commands the Driller to w o rk th e re imp roving oil output. Until a derrick is built,
the oil is not produced. Unless your new oil der rick is next to your capital you mus t
m a k e sure that it is on or within one tile of a connected port or rail depo t .
Otherwise, the oil resources are not reflected in your transport network. 
When a Driller finishes opening a new oil derrick it produces at Level I. Lat e r,
once you have inv e sted in the t e chnology for C h e m i st r y, your Driller can re t u rn
to this Level I derrick and im p rove it to Level II. Ev e n t u a l l y, the t e chnology f o r
I n t e r nal Combus t i o n m a kes Level III derr i c ks possible. Oil production for each
t u rn is calculated at double the level of the derr i c k, so that maximum pr o d u c t i o n
of oil is six units per turn from a single derrick.
Special Civilian Unit: De veloper .
E a ch Great Power is eligible to r e c e i v e one Developer unit as a rew a rd .
Un l i ke other civilians, Dev e l o p e r s cannot be built in the U n i ve rs i t y . No
Great P ower can e ver possess more than one at a time. The De veloper is a
rewa rd for your successful f o reign policy with the Minor Nations. Once
you own a Dev e l o p e r , you can purchase t e rrain tiles in Minor Nations f o r
development, thus providing your country with overseas profits.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 28
--- page 33 ---
You r e c e i v e the Developer rew a rd when your diplomatic relations with at least
one Minor Nation ha ve impr oved suf ficientl y. Generall y, this le vel is reached mos t
qu i c k l y by establishing an Embassy in a Minor Nation, then signing a non-
a g gression pact, and f i n a l l y conducting a good volume of trade with the Minor
Nation for a f ew years. You can speed this process by g ranting bribes to the leader s
of the Minor Nation. All of these diplomatic initiatives are made on the Diplomacy
Screen. For more information see the “Diplomacy” section, starting on page 71.
A Developer w o rks only abroad in Minor Nations. He cannot w o rk within y o u r
own borders. 
Working in Other Countries.
Wo rk perf o rmed by your civilian units in Minor Nations increases the production of
re s o u r ces by those nations. This has two results, both beneficial to your Great Pow e r. 
Fi rst, this increased production increases the amount of that r e s o u r ce off e red in
t rade each turn by the Minor Nation. Instead of w o n d e r ing if a Minor Nation is
going to sell coal, for ex a mple, you are guar a n teed the coal you helped dev e l o p
will be sold each turn. Although this e x t ra coal is off e red on the w o rld market to
all countries, if you are the fav o u red trading partner of the Minor Nation, and if
you remember to enter a trade bid on coal, your Great Power is guar a n teed t h e
chance to purchase the coal ahead of the other Great Powers.
The second benefit is potential ov e rseas pr o fits. N o rm a l l y, when a Minor N a t i o n
sells its r e s o u r ces, the Minor Nation keeps all the money from the sale. Howev e r,
when the r e s o u r ces have been made available on the w o rld market due to
development by a Great P ower, that Great P ower shares in the profits for the sale,
re ga r dless of who buys the r e s o u r ces. The Great Pow e r’s share increases (up to
100%) as the relationship between the two countries improves.
Checklist for Working Abroad
• Establish an Embassy with at least one Minor Nation.
• Send a Prospector to this nation to find valuable minerals.
• Continue to improve relations with the Minor Nation and gain a Developer.
• Send the Developer to the Minor Nation to purchase land with valuable coal, 
iron, gold, gems, cotton, wool, and timber.
• Once land is purchased, deploy other civilians, such as Miners, R a n ch e r s, and 
Farmers, to increase the output of the land.
• Bid on the Bid and Off e rss c reen for the r e s o u r ces you have developed, 
or merely gain money when other Great Powers buy those products.
• View the success of your overseas development in the Deal Book every turn.
• Continue the process with additional Minor Nations.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 29
--- page 34 ---
Example: Overseas Profits.
Once you purchase a t e rrain tile containing a non-mineral r e s o u r ce, the r e s o u rc e
is produced (at Level 0) and sold by the Minor Nation ev e ry turn. Once an
i mp r ovement is built on the land, the amount produced and sold by the Minor
Nation increases. If another Great Power buys these r e s o u r ces from the Minor
Nation, you receive a percentage of the money paid. This cash appears at the end
of the Deal Book s u m m a r y as Overseas Pr o f i t s. If you bid on the r e s o u r ce dur i n g
trade and buy these commodities yourself, you still pay full price on the of fer shee t
d u ring trade; but at the end of trade the ov e rseas pr o fits are re t u rned to you by
the Minor Nation. Eventuall y, this could be a refund of the t otal amount you paid
for the r e s o u r ces if your relations with the Minor Nation im p rove to the highest
possible level.
When you purchase land in a Minor Nation (prior to any development by
civilians), the land produces at Level 0. For most r e s o u r ces, this is one unit per
t u rn; an ex c e ption is minerals where Level 0 is zero production. Howev e r, coal
and iron are produced somewhat dif ferently by Minor Nations: the Minor Nation
m a n a g es to use pr i m i t i v e mining t e ch n i q ues to produce one unit per turn of coal
or iron at Level 0 without opening a mine. Ther e fo re, your purchase of the land
reduces the Minor N a t i o n ’s output of coal or iron because, after your purc h a s e ,
you must open a mine to achieve any production at all.
Establish Embassies.
Wi th the ex c e ption of the Engineer, your civilians can perf o rm useful w o rk in
Minor Nations. Since the Minor Nations cr e a te their own tr a n s p o r t net wo r ks ,
th e re is no need for an Engineer. No civilians may go abroad until you est a b l i s h
an Embassy in the Minor Nation. Once you ha ve an Embassy, civilians may enter
and leave the Minor Nation fr e e ly. Often, it is best to send a Pr o s p e c t or fi rst to
find the most valuable sites containing minerals. This is unnecessary if you decide
to develop only the non-mineral assets of the Minor Nation such as co t ton or
timber. For information on es tablishing Embassies see the “Diplomatic Overtures”
section, starting on page 73. 
Using the De veloper: S taking a Claim.
Once you have decided which sorts of land and r e s o u r ces you wish to develop in
other nations, it is time to use the De veloper. In order to gain extra resources from
a Minor Nation, the Developer must buy each terrain tile individually. 
Wi th your Developer selected, move the cursor over the land you want to buy.
You see a money bag cur s o r. When you click on the f o re sts, fe rtile or barren hills,
m o u n t ains, co t ton plantations, deserts, tundra, or sw a mps under the cur s o r, th e
Developer dialog appears. This gives you the price the Minor Nation asks for that
p a rcel of land and allows you to purchase it if you wish. You can buy land for t h e
production of gold, gems, coal, iron, cotton, wool, and oil. De velopers cannot buy
food production tiles in other countries.
When the Developer has purchased the land, you see a small flag in your Gr e a t
Powe r’s colour posted on the tile. No other Great Power can use this land once
you post a flag. You may notice the purchase flags of other Great Pow e rs in t h e
Minor Nation you hope to develop.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 30
--- page 35 ---
Development of Land.
Land purchased by a Developer st a rts producing for you (and the Minor N a t i o n )
i m m e d i a te l y. This production is at Level 0 until you bring other civilians to t h e
tile and impr ove output. For oil and minerals, Le vel 0 is zero units per turn, so you
must bring your drillers and miners to the Minor Nation to gain the resources.
The benefits from your Dev e l o p e r ’s purchases can be maximised only if you send
other civilian units abroad as well. Your Miners, for instance, can w o rk on
p u rchased mineral sites in ex a c t ly the same way t h ey do in your own lands. As
n ew te chnology im p roves the potential output of mines, the Miner can im p rove
your possessions abroad and at home.
Competing for a Colon y.
A l though the initial benefits of ov e rseas development are significant, your long-
te rm goal must be to make the Minor Nations, whose r e s o u r ces you develop, into
colonies of your Great Pow e r. Once a Minor Nation is colonised you control its
d e fence f o rces and can deploy r e i n fo r cements from your homeland should t h e
c o u n t r y be t h re a t ened. A d d i t i o n a l l y, a colon y ’s relationship to the homeland is
a l ways considered to be at the highest level, giving you 100% of the pr o fits fr o m
the sale of the developed r e s o u r ces. F i n a l l y, once colonised, the Minor N a t i o n ’s
votes at the Council of Gov e rn o r s aut o m a t i c a l l y go to you if your Great Power is
nominated for victory.
Un fo rt u n a te l y, other Great Pow e rs may seek to colonise the same Minor N a t i o n
you hope to gain. Colonies are won in two ways. 
Fi rst, a large number of trade deals coupled with a judicious use of br i b e ry helps
you convince the Minor Nation to accept your in v i tation to join your Em p i re. Fo r
m o re on these methods see the “Effects of Diplomacy on Trade” section, st a rt i n g
on page 63 and the “Joining the Empire” section, starting on page 76. 
Second, when a Minor Nation is att a c ked and asks you to defend it ag a i n st th e
a t tacking Great Pow e r, if you agree to int e rvene, the gr a teful Minor Nation joins
your Em p i re. You gain immediate control over the defence f o rces of the Minor
Nation. Of course, your declaration of war on another Great Power may not be
we l l - re c e i v ed by the r e st of the w o rld. For more inf o rmation see the “Offer to
Intervene in a Minor Nation” section, starting on page 81. 
Eventual Conquest.
Tiles “de veloped” by o ther Great P owers remain in a Minor Nation pr ovince that
is conq u e red. The conq u e ro r , howev e r, now controls all the t e rri to ry in the land
including the land once considered purchased by the other Great Powers.
Since, prior to conquest, the Minor Nation ’s province could use local cheap labour
to tra n s p o r t the commodities to the trading port t h ey had not built a tr a n s p o r t
system. Once the pr ovince is conquered, economic changes begin, and it becomes
n e c e s s a r y to cons t ruct r a i l roads, depots, and ports to move the r e s o u r ces into t h e
transport network of the conquering power.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 31
--- page 36 ---
Land Forces.
Your land milit a ry fo rces consist of regiments. There are 27 diff e rent types of
regiments in the game organised into t h ree eras. During the f i rst era of the g a m e ,
a p p r ox i m a te l y 181 5 - 1845, you may cons t ruct only the f i rst nine regiment types.
As you inv e st in new milit a ry te chnologies in the 1840s, old regiment types are
gradually replaced by new ones in the same generic categories. For e xample, once
a new type of Heavy Cav a l ry is available, you can no longer cons t ruct the older
type of regiment. You may choose to upgrade the older regiments to the new one
w i thin their cat e g o r y, or you may leave your vet e ran troops with inf e rior and
outdated weapons. 
Change occurs again in the 1 870s. Usually by 1 875 ne wer unit types are becoming
available. Once again, you may choose to upgrade your earlier units to the new
type of regiment within their category. 
Regiment Categories.
The nine regiment cat e g o r ies can be upgraded with diff e re n t
te chnologies, but t h e re is a grouping of the available milit a ry
te chnology in the 1840s and in the 1870s. By the end of each of
these decades, all nine categories ha ve normally received their ne w
type of unit. Of course, you must inv e st in the t e chnology to make
the new regiment types available for cons t ruction. For more on
u p grading milit a ry units see the “T e chnological A d vances” section, st a rting on
page 88.  IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 32

Militia.
These local defence f o rces e x i st in all countries and in all provinces at t h e
beginning of the game. As a province develops, additional militia cat e g o r y
regiments are aut o m a t i c a l l y added to the local g a rrison. U n l i ke all of your ot h e r
forces, militia category regiments cannot be ordered to lea ve their home pr ovince.
They fight only when the province is invaded. 
Militia is the only cat e g o r y of land regiments that are not cons t ru c t ed in 
the ar m o u r y and do not r e qu i r e indus t rial w o rke rs to cr e a te. They also upgr a d e
a u to m a t i c a l l y, at no cost to you, when the appr o p ri a t e new t e chnology is purc h a s e d .
M i n u t emen, Militia, and Conscr i pts (the t h ree types of Militia) are the w e a ke s t
units of their r e s p e c t i v e eras. They should remain in their entr e n ch m e n t s
w h e n e ver possible. Their morale br e a ks ra ther easily and their f i re is nor m a l l y
inaccurate.
Light Infantr y.
The t h ree types of Light Inf a n t ry (Skir m i s h e r s, Shar p s h o o te rs, and R a n ge r s) are
adept at using ter rain for concealment and take reduced damage when fired upon.
They mo ve more quickly through rough country than do o ther infantr y. They ar e
best used to dr aw fire from entrenched defenders, giving heavier units a chance t o
approach unmolested.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 33
CONTENTS
--- page 38 ---
Regular Infantr y.
Regulars, Rifle Infantr y, and Modern Infantry are the foundation of most armies.
E s p e c i a l l y useful on defence, Regular Inf a n t ry also pack enough f i re p o we r,
e s p e c i a l l y in the later eras, to help out on the att a c k. If you cannot aff o rd ve ry
m a n y pow e rful units, these regiments are the best com p romise be t ween e x p e n s e
and power in each era.
Heavy Infantr y.
H e avy inf a n t ry (Gr e n a d i e r s, Guards, and Mac h i n e - g u n n e r s) are among the more
ex p e n s i v e of the regiments. Howev e r, for def e n s i v e purposes these regiments are
the best money can buy. Even on the att a c k, these highly trained troops can oft e n
blast through entrenchments manned by weaker types of infantry.
Light Ca valry.
L i ke Light Inf a n t ry, Light Cav a l ry in the f i rst two eras (Hussars, Scouts) is best
used to draw the f i re of entr e n ched hostile regiments so that the attack r e g i m e n t s
can approach closely without taking as much fire from the defenders. Mechanised
Fo rces, the t h i rd era regiments, possess significant f i re p o wer and may be used to
fo l l ow the higher - p riced Armour units, exploiting any br e a ks the Armour cr e a te s
in the enemy lines.
Heavy Ca valry.
Your Heavy Cav a l ry (Cuir a s s i e r s, Carbineers, and Armour) are the best att a c k
pieces available, especially in the f i rst and t h i rd eras. These pieces are e x p e n s i v e
and are not ideal for defence because they cannot entrench.
Light Artiller y.
Light Ar t i l l e r y of all t h ree eras is most useful on the att a c k. These regiments can
m ove q u i c k l y into r a n ge and batter enemy f o rt i f ications and entr e n ch m e n t s .
Un l i ke all heavy ar t i l l e r y, these more mobile units can both move and f i re in t h e
same turn
Heavy Artiller y.
H e avy Ar t i l l e r y is useful on attack and defence, though its slow movement and
poor initiative can be impediments when advancing ag a i n st your foes. Do not let
enemy units get close to your artillery, as it can be destroyed quickly if fired on.
Combat Engineers.
Your Combat Engineers are able to move f o rwa rd and appr o a ch enemy positions
at little risk to t h e m s e l ves using tunnels t h ey can cons t ruct. When the Combat
Engineers reach enemy fortifications and entrenchments, they conduct a po werful
a t tack ag a i n st the position which does not harm the enemy units but can damage
or des t roy the def e n s i v e cons t ruction. Because f o rts are a big adv a n ta g e, th e s e
units are necessary to attack w e l l - p re p a r ed foes. For details on how to use t h e s e
units see the “Combat Engineering” section, starting on page 86. IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 34
--- page 39 ---
Generals.
As a rew a rd for army expansion, you r e c e i v e one or more Generals. A General is
m u c h be t ter at assessing enemy f o rces in adjacent provinces than other local
c o m m a n d e r s. In addition, Generals contr i b u te their leadership abilities to t h e
performances of the ar my in battle by af fecting the morale of units in combat. See
the “Leaders and Morale” section, starting on page 86 for more information.
Order Your Land Forces.
When a land gar rison is selected, the encampment of the gar rison sho ws a flashing
w h i t e outline. The units in this g a rrison appear in the toolbar display. The f i rst
step, using the t o o l b a r , is to select the regiments you want. You are selecting units
for movement or d e rs; it is not necessary to give regiments or d e rs to stay behind
and defend. Unit(s) remaining at the end of the turn aut o m a t i c a l l y defend t h e
province from attack.
No rm a l l y, all the units in the g a rrison are selected for movement by default with
the ex c e ption of Militia cat e g o r ies which cannot be moved. If you want only a
p o rtion of your mobile regiments to leave the province, you can control which
units are selected with the arrows in the toolbar next to each unit type. 
When you give movement or d e rs, the units not included in your selection r e m a i n
behind, along with any militia, to defend the province. The toolbar arrows do not
permit you to select particular regiments of a single category.
If you want to make a more specific selection of f o rces you can use the Garr i s o n
B o o k . See the “Garrison Display Command” section st a rting on page 36. This is
n e c e s s a r y, for instance, if you want a particular vet e ran regiment of Hea v y
Cavalry, among several present in the garrison, to conduct an attack.
Using the Map Cursors.
Deployment.
T h e r e are four diff e rent ways you can move your selected army on the map. The
cursor sho ws the type of mo vement a click on a given pr ovince would order. If you
want to move to an adjacent fr i e n d l y province, click on that province with t h e
M a r c hing Soldier c u rs o r . If you want to move the selected army furt h e r, but s t i l l
in fr i e n d l y te rri to ry, click with the Tra i nc u rsor which appears over the dist a n t
f ri e n d l y province. Your total amount of tr a n s p o r t capacity limits the number of
m i l i ta r y units you can move by train in one turn. You increase the number of
m i l i ta r y units you can move by building more tr a n s p o r t capacity in the r a i lya rd
on the Indus t ry screen. Moving regiments does not in itself use capacity alr e a d y
assigned to tr a n s p o r t re s o u r ces. F i ve points of tr a n s p o r t capacity are needed to
move each armaments point of a military unit. See the “Regiment Abilities” char t
on page 87 for a listing of the Armaments points in each type of military unit.
Attacks.
To enter a province you do not own, you must f i rst declare war on the owner of
the province. On subsequent turns, any adjacent units may att a c k. You cannot
a t tack unless your f o rces are adjacent to the t a rget province. The attack is made
by clicking on the target province with the Crossed Swords cursor.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 35
--- page 40 ---
Landings.
The most dang e rous movement is an attack across the w a te r. Superf i c i a l l y, th i s
seems ex a c t ly like an attack on an adjacent province. Once your f l e ets establish a
landing site, you select land f o rces and use the C rossed Sw o rd s a t tack cursor to
o rder them to move dir e c t ly across the seas to the enemy province. Howev e r, on
the turn that this movement is or d e red, your land f o rces are e x t re m e l y vulner a b l e
to hostile f l e et inte rc e p tion. Any enemy f l e ets ent e ring or present in the sea zone
w i th the landing site aut o m a t i c a l l y inte rc e p t and battle the landing f l e ets. If any of
your ships are sunk, some of your land f o rces may be drowned. For more
i n fo r mation on establishing a landing site see the “Naval Landings” section, st a rt i n g
on page 39.
Toolbar For Regiments.
The Gar rison Display Command.
The f i rst milit a ry command button, which appears as a flag, brings up a
d etailed book on the selected g a rrison. You may also view this book by
clicking with the Blue Question Mark c u rsor dir e c t ly on the g a rri s o n
encampment.
The G a rrison Book s h ows the st a te of the selected g a rrison, including the 
names, the health, and the medals of each regiment. Notice that t h e re are sev e ra l
Militia units listed, but that t h ey bear the legend D e f e n d i n g . Militia units are 
only for local defence.
By clicking on the picture of any other type of unit you may select or unselect it
i n d i v i d u a l l y. As you select a unit its notation c h a n g es from D e f e n d i n g to Av a i l a b l e .
The notation Av a i l a b l e means that the regiment can be or d e red to move or att a c k
when you click on another province. Notice also that the toolbar numbers of
selected units change as you select units on the Garrison Book screen.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 36

The N ext Unit Command.
The Next Unit b u t ton, which appears as a small arrow pointing to the r i g h t

orders to give, but you want another opportunity later in the turn.
The Done Command.
The D o n e b u t ton, t h i rd in the row on the t o o l b a r , appears as a small X.
This command, if given to a selected unit, tells the unit to do nothing f o r
this turn onl y. The unit appears normally in the cycle next turn. You might
use this button when you do not want to mo ve your gar rison, but you want to keep
it in the unit cycle. 
The Defend Command.
L i ke D o n e , the D e f e n d command (a castle wall icon) ends the unit’s tur n .
However, ordering the gar rison to defend remo ves it from the cycle of units
for future turns as well. You might decide to give this order when you ha ve
decided a given garrison is a permanent defence force.
Once a g a rrison is defending, you must use the selection cursor or the Wake all Units
key b o a r d shortcut, by pressing the “ w ” key, to r e sto re the regiments to the unit cy c l e .
Experience.
Regiments gain experience, which is mar ked by a string of medals on the gar rison
book display and in the toolbar during tactical combat. Experience is earned by
p a rticipating in combat. Gener a l ly, participation in t h ree vict o ries or f i ve def e a t s
earns one medal for the regiment.
E a ch medal earned im p roves the initiative and the f i re p o wer of the r e g i m e n t .
I n i t i a t i v e of all units in an army controls the order in which battles are r e s o lve d ,
while initiative of each individual regiment controls when that unit acts in t a c t i c a l
combat. F i re p o wer is sim p ly an attack value, used for both tactical and s t ra te g i c
combat resolution. A regiment which earns the maximum of four medals is
roughly twice as powerful as a unit of the same type with no medals.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 37

Three Me thods of Combat.
On the Pr e fe rences screen you can choose to r e s o lve land battles on a s t ra te g i c
l evel or using tactical battlefields. Once the tactical pr e fe rence is set, you can
choose to r e s o lve the tactical fights y o u rself or order your Defence Minister to do
so. In games with multiple human play e rs, st ra tegic resolution gr e a t ly reduces t h e
waiting time between turns.
Strategic Resolution.
Combat values on the table in the “Regiment Abilities and Com p a rison” section,
found on page 86, are a good way to es t i m a t e st ra tegic resolution. You should
assemble o verwhelming force if possible since you will be unable to take advantag e
of battlefield skills to make up for lack of numbers.
Tactical Battle.
If you choose to r e s o lve your battles on the tactical battlefield, two methods are
available. F i rst, you can conduct all the operations y o u rself. For details on how to
do this, see the “Fighting Battles” section, st a rting on page 82.  Alt e rn a t i ve l y yo u
can ins t ruct your Defence Minister to fight the battle for you; once the battle
begins, click on his picture at the bottom of the tactical toolbar.
Naval Units.
Fleets are represented in two w ays on the map. A fleet on s tation at sea is portr ayed
as a large ship with a w a ke and a bow wave. A f l e et at anchor appears as a ship
with furled sails near the port tile where the fleet is based.
Order Your Fleets.
When a f l e et is selected the ship icon shows a flashing white outline. The ships in
this f l e et appear in the toolbar display. The f i rst step, using the arrows in t h e
toolbar, is to select the ships you want to command. You select ships for mo vement
or mission orders. Mission orders are car ried out in the sea zone where the fleet is
already located. Mo vement sends the fleet to a new location. Fleets cannot do bo th
a mission and a mo ve in the same turn. The only e xception in volves intercepting a
landing f o rce aimed at your beaches. A f l e et ord e red to move into a sea zone
containing hostile landing fleets intercepts the landing.
No rm a l l y, all the ships are selected by default. If you want only a portion of y o u r
ships to perf o rm a mission or move, you can control which ships are selected with
the arrows in the toolbar next to each ship type. IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 38
CONTENTS
--- page 43 ---
When you give mo vement orders, the ships not contained in your selection remain
behind. The toolbar ar rows do not permit you to select particular ships of a single
c a te g o r y. If you want to make a more specific selection of f o rces, you can use t h e
fleet book. For more information see the “Fleet Book Command” section, s tarting
on page 40. This would be necessary, for instance, if you w a n ted a par t i c u l a r
veteran battleship, among several present in the fleet, to conduct a mission.
Using the Map Cursors.
Once you have made a selection of ships using the toolbar or the f l e et book, use a
map cursor to command it. The map cur s o rs allow you to assign your select e d
fl e et in four diff e rent ways: movement to another sea zone plus t h ree kinds of
missions. 
Moving a Fleet.
To move the f l e et, click on a new sea zone with the ship’s Wheel Cur s o r. This
c u rsor does not appear in the f l e et’s current sea zone. If the new zone is out of r a n ge
you see a red slashed circle cur s o r; you cannot move the f l e et that far in one turn. 
Patrols and Bloc kades.
In its present sea zone, a f l e et can patrol, att e mpting to int e rc e p t all hostile ships,
by using the Telescope cursor. A fleet can blockade a designated port, using a ship
with a red “X” cursor, by clicking near the port when that cursor appears. Bo th of
these commands are used ag a i n st enemy f o rces. A blockade has gr e a ter chance of
success than a mere patrol ag a i n st ships that enter or leave the selected port. A
blockade does not seek o ther ships in the sea zone, ho wever, hostile patrolling fleets
can intercept your ships on blockade. 
B oth blockades and patrols can result in battle ag a i n st hostile w a rships, or in
i n te rc e p tion of merchant ships. When merchants are int e rc e p ted, the int e rc e pt i n g
forces can sink or capture the mer chant ships. Additionall y, it is possible to captur e
the cargo being carried. These details are summarised in the battle r e p o r t at t h e
end of the turn.
Naval Landings.
Near the coast you see a Cannon cursor. This allo ws the fleet to es tablish a site for
a later landing of army f o rces. When you assign f l e ets to this mission, you are
a c c e p ting the potential of automatic int e rc e p tions by enemies. Any enemy f l e et
that ent e rs the sea zone or patrols in the sea zone can find and int e rc e p t yo u r
forces. You must be prepared to defeat these attacks. 
You cannot move land f o rces on the turn the landing site is established. Land
fo rces can be moved to the selected enemy province on any subsequent turns, as
long as you maintain the landing site by keeping ships in that sea zone.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 39

Toolbar For Fleets.
The Fleet Book Command.
The f i rst naval command button, which appears as a flag, brings up a
detailed book on the selected fleet. You may also view this book by clicking
with the blue question mark cursor directly on the picture of the fleet.
The F l e et Book s h ows you the details of the selected f l e et; including the names,
the health, and the medals of each ship. By clicking on the picture of a ship y o u
m ay select or unselect it individually. Notice that on the t o o l b a r , the number of
selected units changes as you select units.
You may rename the ships using the F l e e t Book . Click on the name to edit t h e
name text.
The N ext Fleet Command.
The second button, which appears as a small arrow pointing to the r i g h t
side of the screen, advances you from the curr e n t ly selected f l e et to t h e
next unit in your cycle. Use this button when you do not know what order s
to give, but you want another opportunity later in the turn.
The Done Command.
The D o n e b u t ton, t h i rd in the row on the t o o l b a r , appears as a small “X”.
This command, if given to a selected f l e et, tells the f l e et to remain in t h e
same sea zone, trying to stay out of trouble for that turn.
You might use this button when do not want to do an y thing with your f l e et th i s
turn, but expect to have orders for it in the near future. 
The Defend Command.
L i ke D o n e , the D e f e n d command ends the f l e et’s turn. Howev e r, ord e ri n g
the f l e et to defend r e m oves it from the cycle of units for future turns as
well. You might decide to give this order when you have decided a giv e n
fl e et is a permanent defence f o rce in a sea zone, but you do not want it to try to
find enemy ships. Gener a l ly, this button should not be used for f l e ets. It is be t te r
to patrol with a low level of aggression.
Once a f l e et is defending, you must use the selection cursor or the Wake all Units
keyboard shortcut, by pressing the “w” key, to restore the fleet to the unit cycle.
Setting Agg ression Le vels.
D i re c t l y above the ship pictures in the toolbar are t h ree buttons that enable
you to establish the aggression level of a f l e et. The default button (in t h e
middle) means that the f l e et atte mpts to eng a ge any enemy it encount e rs ,
when the officer in c h a rge of your f l e et believes it to be inf e rior to his f o rc e .
This decision is im p o rtant even if your ships are not looking for enemies on a
p a t rol, because enemies may be looking for them. The commander of your f l e et
must decide whe ther to accept battle or try to flee based on this agg ression setting.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 40
--- page 45 ---
The o ther two settings dramatically increase or decrease agg ression. The high le vel
means your commander eng a ges all comers if he believes t h e re is even a r e m ote
chance of vict o ry. This setting is most useful for f o rces whose commander car e s
more about dealing out damage to o thers than preserving his own fleet. The mos t
cautious setting means that the fleet tries to a void battle unless the of ficer in char ge
believes he has an overwhelming advantage.
When deciding which le vel to set, remember that your of ficers can make er rors in
their es t i m a t es about the size of enemy f o rces. When in doubt, you should
ge n e ra l l y choose the more cautious setting, unless it is im p o rtant to defend a
particular zone or damage enemy fleets.

Types of Warships.
Wa rships are classed as either fa stships or b a t t l e ships. F a st ships (Fr i ga te s ,
Ra i d e r s, Ar m o u r ed Cr u i s e r s, and Battlecr u i s e r s) are used pr i m a ri l y for escor t i n g ,
i n te rc e p ting, and blockading. To control a sea zone and des t roy an enemy f l e et
the b a t t l e ships (Ships-of-the-Line, Ironclads, A d vanced Ironclads, and
Dreadnoughts) are superior.
Frigates.
Frigates, the fas test ship ear ly in the game, are cheap to build and good at scouting.
E a rly in the game, t h ey are eff e c t i v e commerce r a i d e r s. Fri ga tes are not scr a p p e d
until Armoured Cruisers enter the game, but they are not very useful once Raider s
can be built instead.
Ships-of-the-Line.
S h i p s - o f - t he-Line remain com p et i t i v e until the A d vanced Ironclad ent e rs th e
game because their mighty firepo wer is useful against raiders and ironclads. Once
you can build Advanced Ironclads, Ships-of-the-Line are all scrapped.
Raiders.
Ra i d e r s are the ideal ship for scouting, escorting, and raiding the merchants of
other Great Pow e rs for many decades. They become obsolete and are scr a p p e d
when Battlecruisers become available.
Ironclads.
I ronclads last until t h ey are replaced by Dreadnoughts. They are more lik e ly to
s u rv i v e a battle than is a Ship-of-the-Line, but Ironclads do not win such
confrontations every time.
Armoured Cruisers.
These Cr u i s e r s are the most efficient vessels for escorting and raiding commer c e .
A l though the later Battlecruiser has gr e a t ly superior abilities, Ar m o u r ed Cr u i s e r s
are much cheaper and remain adequate to the task until the end of the game.
Advanced Ironclads.
Ad vanced Ironclads possess an im p o rtant adv a n ta g e in r a n ge over all ear l i e r
vessels. They are e x p e n s i v e, but are never sold for scrap. Howev e r, once
Dreadnoughts can be built, these ships are not worth much.
Battlecruisers.
Battlecruisers are a luxury item; they are expensive Armoured Cruisers. If you use
them to fight Dreadnoughts, you will be sorry. Howev e r, th ey are unmatc h e d
against any other fastships.
Dreadnoughts.
D readnoughts eff e c t i ve l y dominate the seas, and sink any other vessels t h ey
encounter. The only ships that can fight them are other Dreadnoughts.IMPERIALISM: What Happens on the Ter rain Map 42

Battles.
All fl e et inte rc e p tions and subsequent naval battles are r e s o lved s t ra te g i c a l l y and
then r e p o r ted on the battle r e p o r t screen. The abilities summarised on the “W a rs h i p
Sta t i stics” table control the battle. Superior r a n ge is the most im p o rtant st a t i st i c .
Admirals and Flagships.
As a r eward for na val expansion, you receive Admirals accompanied by a flagship.
An A d m i r al is much be t ter at assessing enemy f o rces in his sea zone than a mere
c a ptain or commodore. In addition, A d m i r als contr i b u te their leadership abilities
and their flagships to the perf o rmance of the f l e et in battle. Flagships are always
the most powerful ship available at the time the reward is received. 
Experience.
Ships gain e x p e r ience in the same ways as regiments. A ship with four medals is
approximately twice as powerful as a ship of the same type with no medals.
Escorts and Repairs.

To assign ships to escort, leave them anc h o red in your home port. They

Ships that suf fer damage in battle must remain in port to be repaired. Ships canno t
repair in the open sea. Ships undergoing repair cannot act as escorts. Only
undamaged ships can take escort duty.
Obsole te Warships.
S o m e times, when t e chnology makes a new w a rship available, all the ships in one
of the older classes are br o ken up for scrap. When obsolete w a rships are br o ke n
up, your minis ter notifies you. The experienced cr ews are spread among the fleet,
increasing overall navy experience.
THE TRANSPORT NET WORK
What is the T ransport N etwork?
All the agr i c u l t u r al, mineral, or indus t rial products of the countries of the w o rl d
a re called commodities. Some commodities are produced in r u ral dis t ricts; some
a re produced only by indus t ry. Most may be traded on the w o rld marke t .
Commodities are divided into t h ree sub-cat e g o r ies: r e s o u r ces, mat e rials, and
goods. R e s o u r ces are commodities that are grown or mined in your country and
not produced industriall y. At the beginning of the game, your transport network is
concerned only with resources.
In the early part of the game, your indus t ry obtains these r e s o u r ce commodities
f rom the t e rrain tiles next to the capital city. Each turn, when you click the E n d
Tu rnb u t ton, the commodities produced in these tiles move to indus t ry, becoming
available for w o rke rs, mills, f a c to r ies, or as an increase to your cash. Some
commodities can be traded on the w o rld market; some can be used to cons t ru c t
military units or warships. 
As the needs of indus t ry grow, so must the tr a n s p o r t net wo r k. The Engineer
c o n st r ucts ports, rail depots, and r a i l roads, perhaps far from the capital city. Each
n ew cons t ruction adds the potential for more commodities to use the ne t wo r k.
O ther civilian units, such as F a rm e r s and Miners, develop t e rrain that is alr e a d y
connected to produce a greater quantity of commodities each turn. 
Transport Capacity .
A l though the civilians w o rking on the Te rrain Map s c reen expand the pool of
commodities which pot e n t i a l l y could be tr a n s p o r ted, your indus t ry cannot use all
these additional commodities without the assets to tr a n s p o r t them. Tr a n s p o r t
capacity is the total number of commodities that your ne t wo r k can move each
turn. This number may be increased by using the rail yard building on the Industr y
s c reen. See the “Building Tr a n s p o r t Capacity” section, st a rting on page 60 f o r
more information.  
Regiments can also be tr a n s p o r ted using the rail ne t wo r k, but at a much low e r
ra te. Each armaments point that a unit has r e qu i r es fi ve points of rail capacity to
t ra n s p o r t. For a listing of v a rious regiments armament point totals, see t h e
“Regimental Abilities and Comparison” section, starting on page 86.IMPERIALISM: The T ransport N etwork44

Rail Depots and Ports.
These s t ru c t u r es, cons t ru c t ed on the T e rrain Map by t h e
E n g i n e e r , expand your tr a n s p o r t net wo r k. Once connect e d ,
d e p o ts and ports can g a ther all commodities that are in the same
space as the depot or port, or in adjacent spaces within your country. It is more
e fficient to build depots and ports with at least two tiles be t ween them so that t h e
commodities of each t e rrain tile can be g a th e r ed by only one depot or port, t h u s
avoiding duplication of effort.
Un c o n n e c t ed depots and ports do not g a ther commodities. The capital city is always
b oth a connected depot and a connected port. Near each depot on the map is a small
signal post. You can tell immediat e ly that a depot is not connected if the two lights
on the signal post are red. If the lights are green, the depot is connected. Alt h o u g h
th e re is no eq u i valent marker for a port, ports are almost always connect e d .
Connecting a Depot.
Since a depot is a r a i l road station, no depot is connected without a r a i l road. A
d e p o t is connected or unconnected depending on whether it has a tr a n s p o r t line
to the capital city. The most obvious line is a r a i l road dir e c t ly from the tile of t h e
d e p o t to the tile of the capital city. Howev e r, a depot may also be connected by
rail to a tile with a port that also contains a depot. The commodities must pass
through the second depot to reach the port and then tr avel to the capital by water .
Connecting a Port.
Ports may be built only on coasts and tiles containing a river. They cost more than
d e p o ts. Howev e r, th ey are much easier to connect than are depots since no
railroad must be built. In general, a port is alw ays connected. Ho wever, if you lose
control of a pr ovince downstream from a river port, your port has no access to the
sea and may not be connected. 
If you choose to build a port on a coast distant from your capital and then build
ra i l roads inland from the port, remember to cons t ruct a depot in the same space
as the port. W i thout this additional depot, the port itself is connected, but t h e
f u t u r e depots cons t ru c t ed along your new r a i l road have no way to move t h e i r
commodities to the port.
How Connections are Lost.
Connections are lost when a province some w h e r e along the line to the capital is
ta ken; for ex a mple, when a province containing a r a i l road is t a ken, or when a
province downstream from a river port is lost. Sea ports can lose their connections
o n ly by hostile f l e et blockades. If an enemy f l e et is in undisputed command of a
sea zone, the ports adjacent to that sea zone lose their connection. U n d i s p u te d
command means that you have no w a rships present in the sea zone cont a i n i n g
the enemy f l e et. As long as any of your ships are present, the ports maintain t h e i r
connections.IMPERIALISM: The T ransport N etwork 45

How to Read and Use the T ransport Screen.
The Tra n s p o r ts c reen is displayed as an open book. All commodities that could be
t ra n s p o r ted appear on one of the two pages, but only commodities pr e s e n t l y
available to you are in colour. Next to each of the available commodities is a slider
for controlling how much of your total tr a n s p o r t capacity you want to use to
t ra n s p o r t that commodity. The numbers under the slider indicate how much of t h e
commodity is being tr a n s p o r ted com p a red to the total amount of the commodity
you have available. You can place your cursor over the commodities and read t h e
h ot text at the upper right to remind you what these commodities ar e .
Click on the arrows at either end of the sliders to increase or decrease the amount
t ra n s p o r ted of each commodity. As you increase the amount, you use some more
of your total tr a n s p o r t capacity, as shown by the coloured bar in the lower r i g h t
section of the book. The numbers under that bar show you how much tr a n s p o r t
capacity is being used com p a red to the total amount of tr a n s p o r t capacity you hav e .

Industry and Wor ker Demands.
C o l o u r ed red or green lines called demand lines appear under n e a th many of t h e
s l i d e r s on the Tra n s p o r ts c reen. The demand lines offer im p o rtant inf o rm a t i o n
about the needs of industry and wor kers. A g reen line means that the cur rent le vel
of tr a n s p o r t for that commodity is enough or more than enough for curr e n t
demand taking your warehouse s tockpile into account. If the commodity is a food,
the demand comes from w o rke rs who need to eat. If the commodity is an
i n d u st r ial one, the demand comes from the mill or f a c to r y that r e qu i r es th a t
commodity for production. A red line means the indus t ries or w o rke rs re qu i r e
m o re of that commodity. The hot text shows you the exact number r e qu i r ed by
industry when the cursor is moved over a particular line.
Since the success of your trading with other countries is not pr e d i c t able, t h e
demand indicators do not take account of potential trade deliveries from abroad.
Transport Example: Using Demand Lines.
You are tr a n s p o r ting six grain per turn, and the line under the grain slider is red, t e l l i n g
you that the w o rke rs want more grain. If you expect to buy significant quantities of
canned food on the w o rld market, you may not need to c h a n g e your or d e rs or e x p a n d
the amount of grain available on your ne t wo r k. Ot h e rwise, you should t a ke steps to
t ra n s p o r t more grain to ensure your w o rke rs do not get sick or st a rve .
Possible Commodities to T ransport.
At the beginning of the game you may only tr a n s p o r t re s o u r ces from the country s i d e
to indus t ry. Lat e r, your r u ral dis t ricts may develop small indus t ries in the to w n s .
This permits expansion of your tr a n s p o r t net wo rk to mat e rials and goods.
Industrial Resources.
These resources mo ve directly to the industry warehouse where they are a vailable
for production or trade the turn after you tr a n s p o r t them. Since the w o rld pr i c e s
of indus t rial re s o u r ces tend to be low, these commodities are most useful to y o u
when you use them, along with wor kers and industr y, to produce a more expensiv e
m a te r ial. If your indus t ry does not r e qu i r e the e x t ra indus t rial re s o u r ces, consider
transporting something else, such as food, instead.
Coal and Iron.
Coal and iron are r e qu i r ed by your steel indus t ry in eq u a l
amounts. In the absence of other sources of one or the ot h e r, such
as a surplus in the w a rehouse or f o reign deliv e ries, you should
t ra n s p o r t coal and iron in equal amounts. Later in the game you may find a
greater need for coal when some of your ships require it for fuel.
Wool and Cotton.

The lumber mill requires timber to produce lumber and paper.
Food Resources.
Your indus t rial w o rke rs try to consume tr a n s p o r ted food each turn; e x t ra food is
m oved to the w a rehouse. Each individual w o rker enjoys only one type of food. This
means you must tr a n s p o r t all t h ree food types to satisfy as many w o rke rs as possible.
Wo rke rs fo rced to eat a type of food t h ey do not enjoy r e p o r t sick and stay home
from work on that turn. 
E ven though food r e s o u r ces cannot be traded on the w o rld market, you should
consider transporting extra food whene ver you can. S tored food feeds your hung ry
wo rke rs when enemies int e rfe re with the tr a n s p o r t net wo r k. In addition, in t h e
food processing centre you may produce canned food from your st o red food. F o r
m o re inf o rmation on how w o rke rs eat and how food is used see the “W o rke rs ”
section, starting on page 53. 
Canned food may be traded or used to r e c ruit more w o rke rs to your indus t ry.
I n d u st r ial w o rke rs eat canned food r e s e rves, if available, in pr e fe rence to an undesir e d
food r e s o u r ce and r e p o rt to w o rk nor m a l ly after consuming the canned f o o d .
Grain.
One-half of your w o rke rs try to eat grain ev e ry turn. Grain f a rms dot t h e
landscape of most Great Pow e rs, so you should be able to find and tr a n s p o r t
additional grain when an increasing population demands more supplies. 
Fruit.
O n e - qu a r ter of your w o rke rs try to eat fruit ev e ry turn. Try to cons t ru c t
your transport network with access to orchards.
Lives tock and Fish.
The remaining w o rke rs desire liv e stock or fish; either one is
accep table. Although lives tock ranches can be rare, you can satisfy
demand by constructing ports and obtaining fish to transport.
Other Resources.
H o rses are used in the ar m o u r y to build milit a ry units and can be stockpiled in
the w a rehouse. Gold and gems never r e a ch the indus t ry wa rehouse and t h ey
cannot be traded. Ins tead, all gems and gold transpor ted con vert immediately int o
cash. You can benefit from gems and gold in an unconq u e red nation t h rough t h e
ove rseas pr o fits fe a t u r e, but this does not use the tr a n s p o r t net wo r k. For more
i n fo r mation on developing Minor Nations see the “W o rking in Other Countr i e s ”
section, starting on page 29. IMPERIALISM: The T ransport N etwork48

Horses.
Generall y, you do not need to transport horses e very turn, since their onl y
use is cons t ruction of cav a l ry and ar t i l l e r y regiments. Build up a st o c k p i l e
of a few horses in the w a rehouse and then use the tr a n s p o r t capacity to
bring in something more immediately useful.
Gold.
Gold may be found in mountain t e rrain. Each unit of gold tr a n s p o r te d
increases your cash by $200.
Gems.
L i ke gold, gems may be found in mountains. Howev e r, unlike gold, g e m s
can only be found in Minor Nations. To obtain gems for your tr a n s p o r t
n et wo r k these nations must be conq u e red. Tr a n s p o r ted gems conv e rt to
cash at $500 per unit.
T own Development.
Each pr ovince you own includes a t own. At the beginning of the game, these t owns
p roduce nothing. Howev e r, if a connected rail depot or port is placed on or ne x t
to the town, industrialisation begins there.
Materials.
O ver time, a connected town begins to pr o d u c e
m a te r ials that are added to the tr a n s p o r t net wo r k and
appear in the Tra n s p o r ts c reen. The type of mat e ri a l s
produced depends on the resources a vailable within the pr ovince of the t own. The
quantity of mat e rials produced depends on the capacity of the indus t ry th a t
demands those mat e rials. The to w n’s gro w th is r e p re s e n t ed on the map by
additional buildings (one of them is a windmill) when the f i rst mat e rial is
produced. T owns produce only s teel, lumber, and fabric. Other materials must be
produced on the Industry screen or purchased on the world market.
Goods.
Once mat e rials become available, the town begins to
d evelop the capacity to produce goods as well. The
tow n’s gro w th to this level is r e p re s e n t ed on the map by
additional buildings including a f a c to r y with smok e sta c ks. The type of goods
eve n t u a l l y available depends on the mat e rials being produced; the maximum
quantity of goods available in the town is always one-half the quantity of t h e
m a te r ials available. Towns can produce consumer goods, t h ey can not pr o d u c e
a rmaments. Armaments must be produced on the I n d u st r ys c reen or purc h a s e d
on the world market.IMPERIALISM: The T ransport N etwork 49
--- page 54 ---
Example: Industrial Gr owth of a T own.
A province consisting pr i m a ri l y of f o re sted land, eight f o re st tiles, includes a to w n
with an adjacent connected rail depot. When the furniture factory of the Industr y
s c reen r e a ches capacity four the town grows and begins to produce one unit of
lumber per turn. Since there are eight forest tiles, the maximum amount of lumber
that could be produced by the t own is four per turn, and the t own slo wly climbs t o
this level. This production does not reduce timber production, it is in addition to
the timber already produced in the pr ovince. Once maximum lumber production
is attained, the town begins to develop its fur n i t u r e output and grows ag a i n .
Maximum fur n i t u r e output is two units per turn, or one-half the production of
lumber by that town
INDUSTR Y
What is Industry?
I n d u st r y is the process by which the commodities you tr a n s p o r t and t h e
commodities you trade for are s tored and used for production into more expensiv e
or useful commodities. You also build all your units on the I n d u st r ys c reen. Each
t u rn, when you click the End T u rnb u t ton on the Te rrain Map s c reen, all t h e
p roduction or d e rs you ent e red on this screen are carried out. Whatever you build
is available the following turn. 
Going to the Industry Screen.
From the Te rrain Map s c reen t o o l b a r , click on the Go to Industry b u t to n
w i th the smoking f a c to r y on it. This button appears in a lighter colour
each turn until you have visited the Industry screen during that turn.IMPERIALISM: Industr y50

Under standing the Buildings.
E a ch building on the I n d u st r ys c reen r e p resents one type of your nation’s
industr y. To find out which building is which, mo ve your cursor o ver the buildings
and read the hot t ext in the upper right of the screen. Clicking on a building brings
up a production dialog for that building. These dialogs may be left open from 
turn to turn. 
On the right side of the screen, the buildings represent industries such as Steel and
Lumber Mills. Movement, such as men sawing, at one of these buildings means
that w o rk is being perf o rmed t h e re. The other buildings on the screen permit y o u
to construct new units for the Ter rain Map, to build mer chant marine, to increase
t ra n s p o r t capacity, to stockpile commodities, to produce canned food, and to
improve and expand your work force. 
Information in the Industry Screen Borders.
On the left border of the screen, you see the make-up of your w o rk fo r ce. The
number beneath the labour icon (the muscular arm) decreases as you allocate
labour to v a rious t a s ks. The numbers beneath the w o rker icons stay const a n t
th roughout the turn; t h ey show the types of w o rke rs which cons t i t u te your labour
force. An untrained wor ker supplies one point of labour per turn. T rained wor kers
supply more labour (two per turn); expert wor kers supply the most (four per turn).
H ot text reminds you which type of w o rker is which, as does the colour of t h e
wo rke r’s cov e rall: gray for untrained w o rke rs, light blue for trained w o rke rs and
dark blue for expert workers.
All wor kers eat food e very turn. The amount of food demanded each turn appear s
on the right border of the screen. The food shown r e p resents the ideal balanced
d i et. Wo rke rs eat any type of food to prevent their own st a rvation, but if t h ey do
not g et the type of food desired they become sick and per form no labour that turn.
You can a void the consequences of an unbalanced diet by s tockpiling canned food
in the w a rehouse. W o rke rs who find none of the desired type of food, eat canned
food before they eat food that makes them sick. Wor kers do not g et sick when the y
eat canned food.
Using the Warehouse.
The W a rehouse, near the top centre of the Indus t ry screen, is the only building
w i th a pur e ly inf o rmational function. It lets you know how much of each
commodity you have available. These commodities are used up and produced in
the other buildings on the screen. If you lea ve the warehouse dialog open and giv e
o rd e r s in a diff e rent building’s dialog, you see the items that are used in t h a t
building deducted from the warehouse. 
The commodities in the w a rehouse are available for trade. When you go to t h e
Bid and Off e rss c reen, the commodities in the w a rehouse at that moment are
what you can offer for sale.IMPERIALISM: Industr y 51

Production Economies.
The warehouse dialog is or ganised in sections according to production economies.
In I M P E R I A L I S M a production economy is a two or t h ree level diagram outlining
h ow a given indus t ry wo rks. The f i rst level commodities in the diagrams are
a l ways called r e s o u r ces — usually items that can be grown or mined. The second
level commodities are called materials and are produced from resources. The thir d
level commodities — called goods — are made from materials.
M o s t of the economies have t h ree levels and r e qu i r e two production buildings,
one to t a ke in r e s o u r ces and make mat e rials and another to t a ke in mat e rials and
m a ke goods. A tw o - l evel economy has only one building to produce the mat e ri a l s
from the resources.
All production within the economies is on a two-for-one basis. For e xample, in the
textile economy two co t ton or wool are r e qu i r ed to make one unit of f a b ric. T wo
units of f a b ric are r e qu i r ed to make one unit of clothing. The details of each
economy are explained below.

Labour .
The buildings on the I n d u st r ys c reen that produce commodities r e qu i r e
labour to make the next le vel commodity from the input commodities. For
example, you might ha ve plenty of cotton or wool in your Warehouse, but
without some labour you cannot produce fabric. 
Labour is symbolised by a muscular arm icon. The number shown with the arm
tells you the total amount of labour supplied by all your available w o rke rs, and
your available pow e r. This number appears on the left bor d e r, and in t h e
Wa rehouse dialog. Each turn, as you assign labour, this number goes do w n ,
showing you the amount remaining available.IMPERIALISM: Industr y52
CONTENTS
--- page 57 ---
Workers.
Wo rke rs supply an amount of labour det e rmined by their training level. When
n ew wo rke rs migr a te to indus t ry, their untrained eff o rts supply only one unit of
labour per turn. A trained w o rker supplies twice as much labour at two per tur n ,
and an expert worker supplies four per turn.
Trade School and T raining.
The Trade School, located on the left side of the I n d u st r ys c reen, im p roves t h e
labour output of your w o rke rs. Click on the red brick building to open the Tr a d e
S chool dialog. Training costs paper and cash. If the amount of cash or paper y o u
have is insufficient, the item has a red “X” next to it. 
Training a w o rker t a kes him out of the labour pool for the turn. If you open t h e
t rade school dialog after assigning all of your available labour to f a c to r ies and
mills, you cannot train. Of course, you can free up labour by opening a f a c to r y or
mill dialog, reducing the number of w o rke rs assigned, and then re t u rning to t h e
Trade School dialog to assign them to train. 
Capitol Building and Mig ration.
The white Capitol building near the centre of the I n d u st r ys c reen controls y o u r
m i gration policies. Click on the building to open the Capitol dialog. To r e c ru i t
ru ral w o rke rs for indus t ry you need to supply them with the comf o rts of a
developing economy: canned foods, clothing, and furniture.
You may r e c ruit untrained w o rke rs using this dialog during ev e ry turn, when y o u
h ave the necessary commodities. Howev e r, the size of your country limits t h e
number of w o rke rs that migr a te during one turn to one-f o u rth of the number of
p rovinces you own, rounded down. Later in the game, your Capitol building may
u p grade in response to successful f o reign policies. Then the limit becomes one-
third of the number of provinces owned.
Be careful not to increase your population too f a st. In addition to the cost of
re c ruiting the new w o rke r, you have to supply the w o rke rs with food each tur n .
This can be dif ficult until you ha ve established a lar ge capacity transport networ k,
or a reliable source of imported food. 
Food Consum ption.
To be able to supply any labour, all w o rke rs must eat one unit of food per tur n ;
each wor ker has a prefer red type of r aw food that he wants to eat. If fed the wrong
type of food, a w o rker gets sick and refuses to w o rk. If fed no food at all, a w o rke r
starves, and is removed from your industrial system.IMPERIALISM: Industr y 53

--- page 58 ---
To understand how w o rke rs’ food pr e fe rences are det e rmined, think of them in
groups of f o u r. Wi thin this group the f i rst wo rker eats grain, the second eats fr u i t ,
the t h i rd eats grain, and the last w o rker eats either liv e stock or f i s h
i n te r ch a n ge a b l y. The count st a rts again, so the f i fth w o rker eats grain. F o o d
preferences are independent of the type of worker (expert, trained, or untrained). 
Consumed food is deducted from the amount tr a n s p o r ted to indus t ry when y o u
click the End T u rnb u t ton. If you do not tr a n s p o r t sufficient amounts of the corr e c t
types of food for all your w o rke rs, some w o rke rs eat by deducting food of t h e
d e s i r ed type from your w a rehouse. If t h ey fail to find their desired type of food in
the w a rehouse, t h ey eat any available canned food from the w a rehouse. As a last
re s o rt, the hungry w o rke rs eat surplus food of the wrong type and get sick. If
workers find no food of any kind, they starve to death. 
Satisfying Your Food Needs.
Canned food is one of the r e qu i r ements to draw migrants to indus t ry. It is also
ex t re m e l y useful as a r e s e rve stockpile, since the r e qu i r ements of any w o rker can
be met by eating it. Of course, you may trade for canned food on the world mar ket.
H oweve r, if you are f o rt u n a t e enough to possess a surplus of all raw food types,
you can produce your own canned food in the Food Processing Centre.
Food Processing.
The production dialog for the Food Processing Centre also functions just like one
for a f a c to r y or mill ex c e pt that t h e re is no capacity limit. You can produce as
much canned food as you want to as long as you ha ve grain, fruit, and lives tock or
fish. Production t a kes place according to the same ratio of foods that the w o rke rs
eat. This means that two g rain, one fruit, and one fish or lives tock are required for
every two units of canned food produced.
Since it is unlikely that you will want to make food e very turn, orders to this centr e
are not saved. 
Pow er.
Power is not a commodity. It cannot be sold or st o red in the W a rehouse and it
re qu i r es no labour to cr e a te. Howev e r, on the turn when it is cr e a ted, power adds
d i re c t l y to your labour total. Power is g e n e ra t ed by building a Power Plant on t h e
Industr yscreen. The option to build a P ower Plant and an Oil Refinery becomes
available once Oil Drilling technology is purchased. 
Creating P ower.
Power is created in the P ower Plant in the same turn it is used. As you increase the
amount of fuel used by the plant, your available amount of labour r i s e s
automaticall y. With enough po wer, you can free a lar ge segment of the work force
to expand the army, or the number of civilian units.
Using P ower.
Power is used aut o m a t i c a l l y when you allocate labour in a production dialog. It is
used in advance of any of your human labour.IMPERIALISM: Industr y54

Building Units.
E a ch of the t h ree unit cons t ruction centres; the U n i ve rs i t y , the Ar m o u r y, and t h e
S h i p ya rd, builds a diff e rent sort of unit: civilians, land regiments, and ships
re s p e c t i ve l y. All new units (with the ex c e ption of merchant ships) appear on t h e
Te rrain Map s c reen at the st a rt of the next turn. All new units (including
m e rchant ships) are announced by one of your Minist e rs at the st a rt of the ne x t
t u rn. New units st a rt their f i rst turn on the T e rrain Map, in the province of t h e
capital, or in port at the capital.
In all t h ree cons t ruction centres, units are built in the same way. Once the dialog
is open, click on the picture of the desired unit to select it. Then control t h e
quantity to be built using the arrows under n e a t h each unit picture. The display
provides information on each type of unit as that unit is selected.
University .
All civilian units r e qu i r e ex p e r t wo rke rs, cash, and paper. If you are short of one
or more of these items, the short a ge appears in red text on the inf o rmation panel
on the U n i ve r sity dialog. It is im p o rtant not to build too many civilian units,
e s p e c i a l l y early in the game. Each unit cons t ru c t ed costs you an e x p e r t wo rke r
f rom your indus t ry, where it supplied a valuable four units of labour each tur n .
Build only what you need. Consider disbanding civilians when you are short of
labour for industry.
At the beginning of the game you can cons t ruct only four types of civilians: t h e
Fa rm e r , the Miner, the Pr o s p e c to r , and the Engineer. Soon after the game begins,
you can inv e st in Feed Gr a s s e s te chnology and I ron R a i l road Br i d ge s te ch n o l o g y .
These developments permit the cons t ruction of the R a n cher and the F o re ste r
re s p e c t i ve l y. Lat e r, Oil Dr i l l i n g te chnology permits cons t ruction of Dr i l l e rs. IMPERIALISM: Industr y 55

The information panel for each unit type, found at the lo wer-left of the University
dialog, provides production inf o rmation according to your current level of
te ch n o l o g y . For ex a mple, at the st a rt of the game, the Miner w o rks at pr o d u c t i o n
l evel “1,” so you see a column of production numbers beneath the number “1.”
This column provides the per turn output of a mine for each type of miner a l .
Information on other civilian units is organised in a similar fashion. 
To view the uses of the v a rious civilians see the “W o rk of Civilian Units” section,
starting on page 25. 
Armour y.
Regiments for your army r e qu i r e cash, armaments, and w o rke rs. Gener a l ly, more
p owe rful or more specialised units r e qu i r e wo rke rs with prior training. Some
regiments also require fuel or horses. If you are short of one or more of these items,
the shor tage appears in red t ext on the information panel on the Armoury dialog.
The gr e a te s t cost to you, especially in the long run, is the loss of w o rke rs. They
can be upg raded to a more advanced type of regiment as new military technology
is purchased, but they can never return to industry.
The or ganisation of the units on the Armoury is by generic category of regiments.
This means that the best a vailable regiment within a generic category at any given
time is the only one you can cons t ruct of that cat e g o r y at that time. The eight
ge n e r ic cat e g o r ies are: Light Inf a n t ry, Regular Inf a n t ry, Heavy Inf a n t r y, Light
C ava l ry, Heavy Cav a l ry, Light Ar t i l l e r y, Heavy Ar t i l l e r y, and Combat Engineer s .
Each category always appears in the same position on the Armoury dialog.
Example of Armoury Construction.
At the beginning of a random w o rld game it is 1815 and you have a “N a p o l e o n i c
Era” regiment a vailable in all eight unit categories. Your Heavy Infantry categor y,
for instance, off e rs G re n a d i e r s , while your Light Cav a l ry cat e g o r y off e rs H u s s a r s .
When you in vest in a new technology, the Bessemer Con verter , the picture of the
Hussars disappears and is replaced b yScouts . At this point, you can no longer build
H u s s a r s ; your Light Cav a l ry cat e g o r y off e rs only the superior regiment, S c o u t s .
H oweve r, you could still build a G re n a d i e r regiment, until a diff e rent t e ch n o l o g y
updates the Heavy Infantry category.
For details on the diff e rent regiments and the cat e g o r ies see the “R e g i m e n t
Categories” section, starting on page 32.
D u ring the game, rew a rds resulting from your milit a ry success can im p rove t h e
Armoury, allowing you to construct troops who start with experience medals.IMPERIALISM: Industr y56

Ship yard.
Ships require lumber and/or s teel for their hulls and fabric, coal, or fuel for motiv e
power. Warships require armaments. If you are short of one or more of these items,
the short a ge appears in red text on the inf o rmation panel on the Shipy a rd dialog.
Ships do not r e qu i r e wo rke rs, allowing you to increase your navy and merc h a n t
marine without decreasing your labour force for industr y. However, since ships do
re qu i r e large amounts of precious commodities, ov e r- c o n st r uction can slow y o u r
early development.
Mer chant Ships.
M e rchant ships do not appear on the t e rrain map. Instead, each merchant ship
you cons t ruct adds its cargo capacity (the number of cargo holds) to the total y o u
h ave available each turn for trade. If you build f a ster ships, the av e ra g e sailing
speed of your merchant marine increases, making blockade and int e rc e pt i o n
m u c h more difficult for hostile navies. You must consider both speed and car g o
capacity when deciding which merchant ships to cons t ruct. F i ve types ev e n t u a l l y
become available: the Tr a d e r, the Indiaman, the Steamship, the Clipper, and t h e
Freighter. 
Warships.
Warships mo ve on the ter rain map in fleets. As your navy g rows you receive bonus
ships, called flagships, each carrying an admiral who helps you in sea combat.
Un l i ke regiments, ships cannot be upgraded and do ev e n t u a l l y become obsolet e .
An obsolete ship is broken up. 
T h e r e are eight ship types available in the game, which can be divided into fa st
ships and b a t t l e ships. The four fa stships, Fr i ga tes, R a i d e r s, Ar m o u r ed Cr u i s e rs ,
and Battlecr u i s e r s, are most eff e c t i v e at blockading or int e rc e p ting merc h a n t s ,
scouting, and escorting convoys. They should not be used in battles to dominate
sea zones unless the enemy uses b a t t l e ships from an earlier era than your fa sts h i p s .
The four b a t t l e ships are Ships-of-the-Line, Ironclads, A d vanced Ironclads, and
D readnoughts. Each of these can dominate the sea during its era and has a good
chance against the fastships of later eras. 
In sea combat, four factors influence the battle. Speed, firepo wer, and armour ar e
all im p o rtant, but the controlling f a c tor is r a n ge. The later w a rships can f i re so
m u c h further than those built early in the century, that one Dreadnought, f o r
example, can sink a large number of Ironclads by itself. 
Building Industr y.
On I n t ro d u c t o r yand E a s y s ettings, six indus t rial buildings are cons t ru c t ed for y o u .
You need not be concerned with cons t ructing indus t ry until the oil r e fi n e r y
becomes a vailable later in the game. On Normal ,Hard, or Nigh-On-Impossible settings,
you must construct your own industry from the beginning.IMPERIALISM: Industr y 57

Industry Constructor .
When factories and mills do not exist, click directly on the future site of the mill or
fa c to r y to cons t ruct them. Use the hot text in the upper right of the screen to
c o n fi r m which site is which. A click on the site brings up the cons t ru c t or dialog
for that factory of mill. You can confirm or cancel construction of the building.
Production Equations.
On the cons t ru c t or dialog, you see a production equation, made up of icons f o r
the f a c to r y or mill explaining the function(s) of that building. The text above t h e
e quation explains it in more detail. The most im p o rtant indus t ries to build early
in the game are the Lumber and S teel Mills. F rom the equations, you can see these
buildings are used to produce lumber and steel. Since lumber and steel are used
for all indus t rial expansion, you must cons t ruct a lumber and steel mill with y o u r
initial stockpiles of lumber and steel, or you may be f o rced to beg for lumber and
steel from other Great Powers.
Cost of Construction.
When a mill is fir st built it is alw ays capacity “2”; a factory begins at capacity “1 .”
For each point of capacity built, you pay one lumber and one steel from y o u r
Wa rehouse. This same cost applies later in the game when you enlarge y o u r
industries.
Expanding Industr y.
When you ha ve excess labour and commodities on your industr y
s c reen, it’s time to expand your indus t ries. In the pr o d u c t i o n
dialog of an indus t ry, locate the Expand Industry b u t ton in t h e

When you click on the Expand Industry b u t ton an Expansion dialog appears. Here y o u
can conf i rm that you want expansion or cancel expansion for this turn. The cost in
lumber and steel is listed on the dialog and a picture of the new building is shown. 
Industrial Capacity .
Capacity (size) is im p roved only in certain increments. For mills, which st a rt at
capacity “2,” the im p rovement levels are capacity “4,” “8,” “1 6 ,” “24” and t h e n
continue to increase by eight at a time. For factories, which s tart at capacity 1, the
impr ovement le vels are “2,” “4,” “8,” “12” and then continue to increase four at a
time. The indus t rial capacity of a f a c to r y or mill is the maximum output in any
one turn.
Giving Orders to Industr y.
All or d e rs to indus t ry are given on production dialogs, floating windows t h a t
appear when you click on one of the buildings. Each dialog includes a pr o d u c t i o n
equation showing you what the building can do, and a slider, or sliders, where you
e n ter the amount of the output commodity you want to produce. For buildings
that have two possible outputs, two sliders are provided, though the capacity y o u
can produce is a combination of what you enter on both sliders.
A red “X” near an item in a production equation tells you that you have no more
of that item available. Additional production cannot be or d e red until that missing
item is supplied.
All production or d e rs at f a c to r ies and mills are saved to the next turn. Even if t h e
wa rehouse stockpile sustains t e mp o ra r y short a ges which lower production, t h e
building “remembers” how many output units you wanted and continues to try t o
fill the order each turn. Howev e r, if you open the production dialog, the memory
of the building r e s ets on whatever or d e rs are shown on the dialog after you give
(or fail to give) your new orders.IMPERIALISM: Industr y 59

TRADE
What is T rade? 
D u ring each turn, all the Great Pow e rs and Minor Nations in the w o rld att e mpt
to buy and sell commodities on the world mar ket. You need to trade to obtain cash,
to provide your indus t ries with r a re re s o u r ces or mat e rials, and to dev e l o p
economic control over Minor Nations. 
Using the Bid and Off e rss c reen, you offer commodities for sale, and enter bids
for commodities you hope to buy. Each turn, when you click the End T u rnb u t to n
on the Terrain Map screen, you may receive of fers to buy some or all of the items
you bid on, and the items you off e red for sale may be sold to other countries. If
you accept an offer to buy, the commodities you buy appear for your use in t h e
I n d u st r ys c reen next turn. Commodities you sell are deducted from t h e
warehouse of your Industry screen. 
Going to the Bid and Of fers screen.
From the Te rrain Map s c reen t o o l b a r , click on the Go to T r a d eb u t ton with
the dollar sign on it. This button appears in a lighter colour each tur n ,
until you have visited the Bid and Offers screen during that turn.

Under standing T rade.
The economy of I M P E R I A L I S M i nvo lves short a ges and com p etition f o r
commodities. Wanting a r e s o u r ce such as coal, for ex a mple, and bidding on it,
does not guar a n tee that your Great Power r e c e i v es coal that turn. Your success
depends on the world price of coal, your Great P ower’s trade policies t oward coal-
p roducing countries, and the diplomatic relationship be t ween your Great Pow e r
and the other countries in the world. 
Once all the Great P owers and Minor Nations enter their of fers to sell and bids t o
buy, and all Great P owers end their turns, a list of the po tential trade deals for this
turn is created. The commodities for sale appear as of fer sheets for the decisions of
the rulers of all bidding countries. For more information see the “Receiving T rade
Offers” section, starting on page 67. 
Example: Of fers of a T rade Deal.
On a turn when the Minor Nation of Belgium decides to sell coal, all of the coal it
o ffe rs fi rst appears as an Offer Sheet to Great Br i tain, the most fav o u red tr a d i n g
p a rtner of Belgium, which bid to buy coal this turn. If the ruler of Br i tain decides
to buy only some (or none) of the off e red coal, then the coal remaining (of
B e l g i u m ’ s offer) passes to the next coal-bidding country on the list of Belgium’s
favo u ri t e trading par t n e rs. This process continues until the bidders purchase all
the offered coal or until there are no more coal bidders. 
Your goal is to put your Great P ower at the top of the f avoured trading partner lis t
of as many other countries as you can. Try to concentr a te on potential tr a d i n g
p a rt n e r s that produce the commodities you most need. You must consider and
wo rk with a v a ri ety of f a c to r s, including w o rld prices, trade policies, and
diplomatic relationships.
Prices.
The prices shown on the Bid and Off e rss c reen are the w o rld market prices f o r
the commodities traded during the previous tur n. This price is a s tarting point for
this tur n’s price, which may go higher or lo wer depending on supply and demand.
If, during this turn, demand for a commodity is stronger than the suppl y, the price
rises. If the rev e rse is true, the price falls. If supply and demand are closely
matched, the price this turn remains much the same as last turn’s price.
All Minor Nations, and sometimes Great Pow e rs as well, decide which of t h e i r
p roducts to offer for sale, based in part on the w o rld market price from last tur n .
As prices rise, more countries offer the product for sale. Ev e n t u a l l y, the new
supplies begin to drive prices down again.
When you enter your bids and off e rs, it is impossible to predict the final price f o r
this turn, because the buy bids and sell off e rs which det e rmine the price come
from all the countries in the game, not just from your own Great Power.IMPERIALISM: Trade 62
--- page 67 ---
Trade Subsidies.
Because obtaining scarce r e s o u r ces can be difficult, especially at the beginning of
the game, your tr a d e r s may need the assistance of beneficial trade policies. Y o u
m ay choose to grant trade subsidies using the Diplomacy screen. For more
information see the “Trade Policies” section, starting on page 78. 
When your Great Power grants a trade subsidy to another country, the price of
commodities traded between the two countries changes by the percentage amount
of the subsidy. This fav o u rs the other country on both ends of trade deals with
you. When your Great P ower buys from that countr y, prices are higher, and when
your Great Power sells to them, prices are lower.
This reduction of your pr o fits usually pays for itself in the long run. Since ot h e r
c o u n t r ies often decide to offer their products to the countries that pay them t h e
m o st, your tr a d e r s enjoy an adv a n ta g e over all other bidders for the r e s o u rc e s
grown or mined by that country. Your com p et i to r s are the r u l e rs of the ot h e r
G reat Pow e rs, not the Minor Nations. Off e ring subsidies to the Minor N a t i o n s
g i ves your Great Power an adv a n ta g e over the com p etition, in re t u rn for a
marginal (and often temporary) reduction in profits.
Effects of Diplomacy on T rade.
Subsidised prices and im p roved diplomatic relations both affect the order in which
c o u n t r ies re c e i v e off e rs to buy commodities. Countries with commodities to sell
combine both f a c to r s to decide which country is the most fav o u red trading par t n e r.IMPERIALISM: Trade 63

You im p rove diplomatic relations using the D i p l o m a c y s c reen. For det a i l e d
i n st r uctions, see the “F o reign Aid and Br i b e ry” section, st a rting on page 77. But
t rade affects diplomacy, too. Each time your Great Power com p l etes a deal with
a n other country where you have established a trade consulate or an Embassy, t h e
relationship with that country im p roves slightly. By choosing a few nations to be
regular trading par t n e rs, you can focus the effects of your diplomacy and tr a d e .
Your diplomacy gets your trading off to a f a st sta rt; trade causes relations to
improve more quickly, giving you more options in diplomacy.
Information in Screen Border .
The wooden bor d e rs of the Bid and Off e rss c reen display icons r e p re s e n t i n g
commodities that the indus t rial w o rke rs need. The most im p o rtant is the canned
food icon. When this appears, it means that your w o rke rs, th re a t ened by sickness
or starvation, demand that the traders obtain some food from abroad. 
The appearance of o ther commodity icons tells you that you are in short supply of
that commodity; that is, the capacity of the f a c to r y or mill that r e qu i r es th a t
commodity for production e xceeds the warehouse s tockpile, and the amount being
transported to industry within your Empire.
Example: Using Border Information on the “Bid and Of fers” Screen.
If the indus t rial capacity of your steel mill is “1 6 ,” for ex a mple, and you have set
your Tra n s p o r ts c reen slider to tr a n s p o r t four units of iron, and your w a re h o u s e
c o n t ains ten units of iron; then an iron icon appears in the Bid and Off e rss c re e n
b o rd e r , to show you that your steel mill can use two more units of iron this tur n .
This might be a good reason to enter a bid on iron.
Giving T rade Orders.
Your tr a d e r s need not be told what to do ev e ry turn. Once you have est a b l i s h e d
your or d e rs, you visit the Bid and Off e rss c reen only to c h a n g e them. Of cour s e ,
if cir c u m s tances c h a n g e, you might decide to visit the Bid and Off e rss c reen to
consider your new needs.
A buy bid ins t ructs your tr a d e r s to consider all available off e rs of the r e qu e s te d
c o m m o d i t y . A sell offer includes inf o rmation from you about the maximum amount
you wish to sell. Your tr a d e r s continue to offer the commodity to bidders until t h e
amount you select is sold or until all bidders have r e j e c t ed the remaining amount.
Sliding brass bars are used to mark your buy bids and sell off e rs. To enter a bid,
click on the brass loop immediately to the left of the appropriate commodity icon.
The Bid Bar for that commodity slides out of the wood. Enter sell off e rs using t h e
other bar and loop to the right of the Bid Bar . When the O ffer Bar slides out, a slider
and a sell quantity number appear in the Quantity to Of f e rcolumn. Using the arrows
to the right and left of this slider you increase or decrease the amount of t h e
commodity to offer.IMPERIALISM: Trade 64

Deciding What to Bid On.
The economy of IMPERIALISM recreates the age when mer chants and industrialists
of Great Pow e rs ga rn e r ed huge pr o fits by obtaining raw r e s o u r ces from abroad at
l ow cost, and selling products manuf a c t u r ed from the r e s o u r ces back to the same
people who grew or mined the original r e s o u r ces. Often the influx of c h e a p
m a n u fa c t u r ed goods from abroad would des t roy the market for local pr o d u c t i o n
of the Minor Nation, guar a n teeing the Great Power a market for its goods.
S o m e times Great Pow e rs qu i te int e n t i o n a l l y discour a ged local production to
increase the profits of their own industries.
As ruler of a Great Pow e r, you t a ke adv a n ta g e of such opportunities. Enter bids
on re s o u r ces such as coal, iron, co t ton, and timber. Great Pow e rs ge n e ra l l y avo i d
selling these commodities, so your trading partners are Minor Nations for the mos t
part. On the o ther hand, if you enter bids on materials such as s teel, or goods suc h
as har d wa r e, the cash you pay for these commodities helps your opponents, t h e
other Great Powers. 
Limits on Bidding.
You may bid on only four commodities each turn. 
Deciding What to Of fer for Sale.
Your challenge in of fering items for sale lies in balancing the internal needs of your
G reat Power with the need for immediate pr o fits from trade. Clothing and
f u rn i t u r e, for ex a mple, may be sold on the w o rld market for substantial g a i n s .
However, encouraging mig ration and increasing the number of industrial wor kers
requires the expenditure of clothing and furniture in the capital building.
For the most part, price levels cr e a te a situation where the most eff i c i e n t
commodities to sell are the four goods: clothing, fur n i t u r e, har d wa r e, and
armaments. Ho wever, if demand for materials such as s teel or lumber pushes their
p rices high enough, it can become more efficient to sell these commodities. The
G reat Pow e rs that purchase your mat e rials can use them for indus t rial or milit a ry
expansion. Most goods go to the Minor Nations, not your competition.
Limits on Of fering.
You may offer for sale as many diff e rent commodities as you hold in y o u r
wa rehouse stockpile, unused by indus t ry this turn. Howev e r, the quantity of each
commodity off e re d c a n n o t exceed the total merchant marine number of y o u r
G reat Pow e r. For more inf o rmation see the “Merchant Marine” section, t h a t
fo l l ows. This number appears in the right border of the screen under n e a t h th e
ship icon.IMPERIALISM: Trade 65
--- page 70 ---
Merchant Marine.
The merchant marine number r e p resents the total cargo holds available in all t h e
m e rchant ships owned by your Great Pow e r. Each cargo hold can carry one unit
of any trading commodity. The total merchant marine number establishes t h e
maximum amount you can offer for sale of any one item. A more significant limit
on trading, under most circums tances, is the fact that each cargo hold can be used
only once per turn. 
Examples: Limits of Mer chant Marine.
E ven though you can offer four units of clothing and four units of fur n i t u r e
because your merchant marine number is f o u r, it is unlik e ly you can sell all eight
units because you have only a total of four cargo holds. You might sell more t h a n
the four you can deliver if the buyer is a Great Power with its own cargo holds.
Not only does the merchant marine number limit how much you can sell; it also
limits the amount of commodities you can buy. If your merchant marine number
is four and you sell four units of clothing to a Minor Nation, none of the bids y o u
e n te r ed this turn can be filled. You can buy nothing if you have no merc h a n t
marine to move the cargo.
How the Mer chant Marine is Used.
Mer chant Marine of Other Great P owers.
No Minor Nation owns merchant marine. When you trade with a Minor N a t i o n ,
as either buyer or seller, you can be sure that your merchant marine is r e qu i re d .
H oweve r, since the other Great Pow e rs do own ships, your merchant marine is
not always used when you trade with them.
The rule for trades be t ween Great Pow e rs is that the buyer always picks up t h e
commodities. If a bidder has no remaining cargo holds available, the bidder is not
p e rm i t t ed to accept the deal, and the items are off e red to the next bidder on the lis t .
Commodity Order .
To make planning ahead with your merchant marine possible, I M P E R I A L I S M
a l ways uses an established order when expending the Great Pow e rs’ merc h a n t
m a rine for trade. This commodity order is shown on the Bid and Off e rss c re e n
f rom top to bo t tom. Clothing deals, for ex a mple, are always considered prior to
all other deals because clothing is the f i rst item in commodity or d e r. Re s e rv i n g
some cargo holds for later deals becomes an impor tant skill. For more information,
see the “Merchant Marine and Commodity Order” section, starting on page 69.IMPERIALISM: Trade 66

Interceptions.
Once your Great Power declares w a r, or is att a c ked by another Great Pow e r, yo u r
m e rchant marine can be int e rc e p ted, and sunk or des t royed. Of course, you can do
the same to your enemies. You r e c e i v e not i fications of both successful int e rc e pt i o n
of enemies’ merchants, and losses among your own in the battle r e p o rt .
Escorts.
To reduce the potential for losses among your merchant marine, w a rship escor t s
m ay be assigned. Any ship docked at your capital and fully r e p a i r ed is used to
escort merchants during that turn.

Accepting/Rejecting Of fers.
Once all Great Pow e rs end their turns, the w o rld market opens. You now r e c e i v e
offers from countries selling the commodities you bid on using the Bid and Of fers

to ch a n g e the quantity to accept any lower amount. By placing your cursor ov e r
the picture of the commodity on the offer sheet you can see hot text in the upper-
right which tells you the amount of that commodity in your warehouse.
A fter you (the potential buyer) act on each off e r, any commodities remaining are
passed on to o ther countries that bid on those commodities. Of course, you might
n ot be the f i rst buyer in line. The off e rs you see may already have been passed up
by other countries acting ahead of you.IMPERIALISM: Trade 67

Mer chant Marine and Commodity Order .
A basic component of trade is the careful use of your merchant marine each tur n .
For ex a mple, on a turn when you plan to sell stockpiled har d wa r e, consider
c a re f u l l y what items you can accept with the remaining cargo capacity once t h e
n e c e s s a r y amount is used for har d wa r e. On a turn when you have v e ry little to
sell, bid on canned food or other items that you nor m a l l y would not have ships
available to move. 
O ffe rs always occur in the same or d e r, the commodity order shown on the B i d
and Off e rss c reen, and in the tabs on the side of the trade book. This means, f o r
exa mple, that if you desper a te ly need iron, you may need to stop accepting all t h e
wool you can get in order to r e s e rve some of your limited merchant mar i n e
capacity for the iron coming later.
For ex a mple, click on the Trade Book’s i ron tab to look at the market in iron. If
one of the countries selling iron shows your f lag as its top bidder, you can count
on receiving an iron offer this turn. Save some merchant marine for it.
The Deal Book .
At the end of e very trade of fers phase, before the new turn begins, the Deal Book
is displayed. It opens to the page showing a summary of all of your trades. Y o u
may need to turn se veral pages to see all the deals you ha ve concluded. If you want
to look at the Deal Book during your turn, it can be brought up through the Help
and Inf o rm a t i o n dialog, for more inf o rmation see the “Help and Inf o rm a t i o n

Summary of T rading & Overseas Profits.
One page on the Deal Book includes a summary of all your trades. Ev e n t u a l l y,
your o verseas profits add to the positive side on this balance sheet. Overseas profits
a re any money you make when another country sells something or mines some
gold or gems. The only way to earn this beneficial bonus is by purchasing land in
a Minor Nation with a De veloper and then increasing production of the land wit h
your other civilian units. For more on how to do this see the “W o rking In Ot h e r
Nations” section, starting on page 29. 
Your Great Power also incurs c h a rges for milit a ry upkeep. As your armies and
navies expand and modernise, you must pay more each turn.
Your Great P ower’s Credit.
S o m e times you may spend too much money and end a trade off e rs phase in t h e
red. The Deal Book tells you this, and lists your borrowing limit. If you go over t h i s
limit, you r e c e i v e a w a rning about a f o rced sale of your w a rehouse stockpile. The
p rices paid during a f o rced sale are q u i te low, and it is a good idea to avoid it if y o u
can. Also, you cannot make purchases nor can you give or d e rs that r e qu i r e an
ex p e n d i t u r e during your turn, as long as your debt exceeds your limit.
On the other hand, t h e re is nothing wrong with borrowing as long as you stay
within one-half of your credit limit. If you go o ver one-half the maximum allo wed
your interest rate s tarts to worsen until the money is paid back. On the o ther hand,
since the world banking community likes to ha ve countries in debt, e very time you
re p ay the money you have borrowed, the int e re st ra te for future loans im p rove s .
Your credit limit also increases as your national income rises.IMPERIALISM: Trade 70

DIPLOMACY
What is Diplomacy?
Diplomacy provides a s t ru c t u r e for your int e raction with the other countries in
the w o rld. Also, the D i p l o m a c y s c reen provides useful inf o rmation for plo t t i n g
your ov e rall st ra te g y . As with other activities in I M P E R I A L I S M , the or d e rs you give
in diplomacy are carried out simult a n e o u s l y with other Great Pow e rs’ ord e rs at
the end of the turn. Until you click the End T u rnb u t ton you can t a ke back any
diplomatic orders you give.
T h e r e are t h ree ways to im p rove your relations with another country: establish a
non-agg ression pact, g rant foreign aid,and conduct trade. You won ’t see the colour
code showing the relationship c h a n g e eve ry time you t a ke an action. The benef i t s
of diplomatic actions build up over time; although t h ey are gradual, t h ey are
essential to success.
The q u i c ke s t way to im p rove relations is f i rst to build a trade consulate, and t h e n
to trade fr e qu e n t l y with the nation you are courting. Use trade subsidies to secure
your status as most-favoured trade partner.

Relationships.
The small r e c tangular document (which r e p resents a grant of f o reign aid)
b rings up the relationship display for any country in the game. U n l i ke th e
t reaties display, the relationships shown do not im p ly any f o rmal status be t we e n
two countries. Ins tead you are viewing the relative le vels of friendliness. Of course,
a particular treaty s tatus might lead to more or less friendly relations. For ins tance,
you would usually see a correlation be t ween hostile feelings and the f o rmal st a t u s
of war on the treaty display.
Trade Policies.
The ship icon allows you to view the trade policies of any country. In t h e
l ower portion of the screen is a list of the top e x p o r ts of the country. Use
this listing to decide which Minor Nations to invade or to court diplomatically.
On the map you see the e x i stence of any trade subsidies or boy c otts be t ween two
c o u n t r ies. Both boy c otts and subsidies are initiated by Great Pow e rs. A subsidy
means that the Great Power is paying more than market price for the tr a d e
commodities of the other country, as well as selling its own commodities at low e r
c o st to the other country. A boy c ott means that no trade of any kind occurs
between the two countries.IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 72

Who is Winning: Council Report.
Once the Council of Go vernors meets for the fir st time, you may r eview the v oting
results of the last council meeting by clicking on the lower left tab on t h e
D i p l o m a c y s c reen. The map portion of the screen shows flags in each pro v i n c e
that voted at the last meeting, and the lower portion of the screen shows you t h e
vote totals of the two nominated Great P owers. For more on the Council see “Ho w

Diplomatic Overtures.
On the right side of the lower portion of the D i p l o m a c y s c reen are t h re e
tabs that allow dif ferent sorts of diplomatic initiatives. Clicking on the fir st
of these, the large tab with the scroll, allows you to make diplomatic
overtures to the other countries in the game.
How to Make an Overture.
The ov e rt u r es map always displays the treaty status of your own country. To view
i n fo r mation on treaties be t ween other countries you must use the inf o rmation tab.  A
n ew ov e rt u r e tow a rd any country may be made by clicking f i rst on the desired scr o l l
on the lower portion of the screen, and then clicking on the country on the map. 
When you click on the scroll, your cursor changes to represent the type of o vertur e
you are making. When you click on the countr y, an icon s tays behind to mark that
you made the overture. 
To cancel the o verture before the end of the turn, click on the icon on the countr y.
It disappears conf i rming that you have rescinded that ov e rt u r e. If the ov e rt u r e
costs mone y, the amount you spent is r eturned to your treasury upon cancellation.
War and Peace.
At the beginning of the game, your Great Power is at peace with ev e ryone. The
ove rt u r e of a declaration of war may be made to any Great Power or Minor
Nation. Once you are at war with a countr y, the peace o verture becomes a vailable.
Unlike most o vertures, a country cannot refuse a declaration of war. If you declar e
war on a country, it r e c e i v es no t i fication of the war as soon as you click the E n d
Turnbutton, and the war begins on the next turn. You must declare war in order t o
conduct any type of hostile action on land or sea. Ob v i o u s l y, war w o rsens t h e
relations between your country and those with whom you are at war.
Less ob v i o u s l y, whenever you declare w a r, your relations with all countries in t h e
game can change significantl y. Countries that dislike the country you attacked ar e
m o re fri e n d l y tow a rd you after you declare w a r. Countries with good r e l a t i o n s
with your victim dislike you more after you declare war. IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 73

It is wise to t a ke this fallout into account when deciding what Minor Nation to
a t ta c k . All Minor Nations like their neighbouring Minor Nations and believe t h a t
their own f a te is tied to the f a te of their neighbours. You should aim your w a r
machine at Minor Nations distant from those you trade with every turn.
Minor Nations never refuse an offer of peace. They are always happy to have a
G reat Power stop attacking them. Great Pow e rs, on the other hand, accept peace
o ffe rs only when it is to their adv a n ta g e to do so. Gener a l ly, if t h ey have obt a i n e d
what t h ey wa n ted and are not able to t a ke your capital at this time, t h ey accept
your peace overtures.
Diplomatic Overtures to Minor Nations.
At the beginning of the game, the diplomatic ov e rt u r es it is possible to make to
Minor Nations are limited. A declaration of war is always available, but more
c o mp l e x relationships must be built over time. Sometimes one successful ov e rt u r e
is re qu i r ed bef o re another one can be att e mpted. At the beginning of the g a m e ,
your f i rst step is to establish trade consulates in some of the Minor Nations. Lat e r
you may establish Embassies, offer non-aggression pacts, and att e mpt to con v i n c e
Minor Nations to join your Empire.IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 74

Trade Consulates.
Minor Nations always accept an ov e rt u r e to establish a trade consulate. The ov e rt u r e
c o sts you $500 and the new consulate opens st a rting the turn after you make t h e
ove rt u r e. The most immediate benefit of a new consulate is the right to set tr a d e
policies tow a rd that Minor Nation, policies such as subsidies to encour a ge tra d e .
Trade policies are set using the tab with the ship icon on the right side of the screen. 
Once a new trade consulate is established in a nation, each com p l eted trade deal
b et w een your Em p i re and this nation im p roves your diplomatic relationship. If
relations im p rove enough, some of the council votes of the other nation might go
to you. Ev e n t u a l l y, their leaders could decide to join your Em p i re peacefully as a
colony provided you build an Embassy. 
A trade consulate is required for the later construction of an Embassy. 
Embassies.
Once you establish a trade consulate in a Minor Nation, you are able to est a b l i s h
an Embassy in the Minor Nation as well. The Embassy ov e rt u r e costs $5000; at
the beginning of the game, you need to be restrained in your of fers. Minor Nations
never refuse your request to establish an Embassy.
Embassies permit full-fledged diplomatic relations including g rants of foreign aid,
pacts and other treaties, and the possibility of armed int e rvention if the Minor
Nation is invaded. Until you establish an Embassy, your civilian w o rke rs may not
enter the Minor Nation. Because Embassies are so expensive, you should generall y
establish Embassies only in Minor Nations where your intentions are peaceful. 
Only Minor Nations where you ha ve Embassies e ver join your Empire voluntaril y.IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 75

Non-Aggression Pacts.
Once you have established an Embassy, you are able to offer a pact ov e rt u r e to
the Minor Nation. This action costs no cash and it’s a good idea to offer the pact
to all Minor Nations where you es tablish Embassies. Minor Nations alw ays accep t
an of fered non-agg ression pact, since it limits the actions of Great P owers. In fact,
th ey are so happy to r e c e i v e a pact that it signif i c a n t l y im p roves your Gr e a t
Power’s relationship with the Minor Nation.
A non-aggression pact hurts you only if you break it. If this happens, the nor m a l
wo rsening of your relationships across the w o rld is signif i c a n t l y increased. Ot h e r
countries believe you can no longer be trusted.
Joining the Empire.
The Em p i re scroll on the diplomatic ov e rt u r es screen allows you to ask a Minor
Nation to join your Empire voluntaril y. This o verture costs no thing, but the Minor
Nation declines it if your relations are not suff i c i e n t l y fri e n d l y. Using t h e
i n fo r mation tab you can look at your relationships w o rldwide. If your r e l a t i o n s
with any Minor Nations ha ve impr oved to a dark g reen colour, an o verture to join
your Empire might be accepted by that nation.
When a Minor Nation joins your Em p i re vo l u n ta ri l y it is called a colony. Y o u
c o n t r ol all the regiments owned by the Minor Nation, and you can r e i n fo r ce th e
c o l o n y with your own f o rces. You always have pr i o rity over all other countries f o r
the purchase of the colon y ’s commodities, and the votes of the colon y ’s pro v i n c e s
go to you if you are nominated for victory.
Un l i ke te rri to ry you conq u e r, the colony still retains a modicum of independence.
It produces and purchases commodities on its own, for instance, providing a
g u a ra n t eed market for your goods. In a colony you must purchase lands f o r
development with a De veloper civilian unit; whereas with conquered ter ritory this
is unnecessary.
Diplomatic Overtures to Great P owers.
At the beginning of the game, your Great Power already has embassies, which
include trade consulates, in ev e ry Great Pow e r. These embassies permit full-
fledged diplomacy with all o ther Great P owers right from the s tart of the game. If
you fight a war, it is necessary to re-establish your embassies when peace is made.
Alliances.
You can offer an alliance only to Great Pow e rs. An alliance, if agreed t o ,
e stablishes a promise of mutual defence if either ally is att a c ked by a t h i rd Gr e a t
Powe r. When your ally is att a c ked, you r e c e i v e notice of the declaration of w a r
and an immediate demand by the ally that you declare war on the aggr e s s o r . If
you are att a c ked, your allies, if any, r e c e i v e notices of demand for a declaration of
wa r. The alliance is immediat e ly bro ken when a Great Power refuses to support
an att a c ked ally. The refusing ally suff e rs sev e re penalties in w o rld opinion
resulting in across-the-board worsening of relations.IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 76
--- page 81 ---
A similar notice is delivered to you if your ally is the agg ressor against a third Great
Powe r. The consequences of a refusal to join this war are q u i te diff e rent. R e f u s a l
to join a war when the ally is the aggressor does not result in any penalties. Allies
m u st re c e i v e an offer to join the w a r, but cannot be held responsible for t h e
judgment errors of other Great Powers.
G reat Pow e rs offer and accept alliances based on the milit a ry conditions of t h e
oth e rs. Great Pow e rs in a position of disadv a n ta g e are both more lik e ly to off e r
and to accept an alliance. Choose your allies carefully.
Joining the Empire.
You can ask Great P owers to join your Empire. They ag ree only if their position in
the game is hopeless due to your success. Agreeing to such an offer r e m oves t h a t
power from the game. Accepting such an o verture from ano ther Great P ower ends
the game for a human player as well; you should decline it if you wish to k e e p
playing.
Foreign Aid and Briber y.
The second tab on the right side of the D i p l o m a c y s c reen allows you to
grant money to any country in the game where you have an Embassy. This
cash gift dir e c t ly im p roves the diplomatic relations be t ween the countr i e s .
For the most part, you want to grant funds to Minor Nations, not Great Pow e rs ,
since t h e re is little chance that good relations with other Great Pow e rs — y o u r
c o mp e tition — can help you win the game. Im p roving relations with Minor N a t i o n s
can put you ahead in the race to grab colonies bef o re the other Great Pow e rs .
How to Grant Mone y.
The grants map always displays the relationships of your own country. To view
i n fo r mation on relationships be t ween two other countries, you must use t h e
i n fo r mation tab. A new grant tow a rd any country may be made by clicking f i rst
on the desired grant amount on the lower portion of the screen and then clicking
on the country on the map. 
When you click on the g rant certificate, your cursor changes to represent the g rant
you are making. When you click on the country, an icon stays behind mar k i n g
that you made the grant. 
To cancel the g rant before the end of the turn, click on the icon on the countr y. It
d i s a p p e a r s to show that you have rescinded that grant. The amount you spent is
returned to your treasury upon cancellation.
Locked Grants.
L o c k ed grants function just like normal grants ex c e pt that t h ey continue ev e ry
t u rn with no further order from you. The cumulative effect of ten $1000 grants is
greater than one $10,000 g rant, so locked g rants are a good idea if you can af ford
the regular drain from your cash, and you are not in a hurry to see results.IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 77

Assessing Success of Grants Policy .
The nine relationship levels are colour-coded, but an immediate c h a n g e in colour
does not occur with each grant. Remember which Minor Nations are r e c e i v i n g
your funds and w a t ch for them during the trade off e rs each turn. If you see y o u r
position in the line of bidders for that Minor N a t i o n ’s products moving up, y o u
k n ow that your grants are having an effect on the r e l a t i v e relationships be t we e n
the Minor Nation and all the Great Powers.
You should use the inf o rmation tab (grants icon display) to keep an eye on all t h e
relationships of this Minor Nation. Select the Minor Nation and see if any ot h e r
G reat Pow e rs have a colour as fr i e n d l y as y o u rs. See who is listed as the most
favo u red trading partner and who is listed as having the best relations. As y o u
grant mone y, you should be able to see your country in these sections of the displa y
unless other Great Powers are granting as much or more than you are.
Trade Policies.
The third and lo west tab on the right side of the Diplomacy screen enables
you to set trade policies with any country in the game where you have a
t rade consulate or Embassy. While these policies cannot dir e c t ly im p rove
relations, t h ey can encour a ge trade with the other country, t h e re b y im p rov i n g
relations with each successful trade deal. For the most part, you grant tr a d e
subsidies to Minor Nations. Trade subsidies with Minor Nations can put y o u
ahead of the o ther Great P owers in the race to g rab colonies and immediately help
you acquire needed resources through trade.IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 78

Making a T rade Policy .
The map always displays the trade policies of your own country. To view
i n fo r mation on the trade policies of other countries you must use the inf o rm a t i o n
tab. A new trade subsidy of v a rying per c e n ta g es, or boy c ott tow a rd any country,
m ay be made by clicking f i rst on one of the symbols on the lower portion of t h e
screen, and then clicking on the country on the map. 
When you click on the symbol, your cursor c h a n g es to r e p resent the type of tr a d e
policy you are setting. When you click on the country, an icon stays behind
marking that you made the new policy. 
To cancel the policy c h a n g e bef o re the end of the turn, click on the icon on t h e
country. It disappears confirming that you have cancelled that change.
Subsidies.
Subsidies have two immediate price effects, both to the adv a n ta g e of the country
that r e c e i v es the subsidy. When the recipient country buys from the Great Pow e r
that gr a n ted the subsidy, its prices are reduced from the current w o rld prices by
the percentage of the subsidy. When the recipient country sells to the Great P ower
that gr a n ted the subsidy it sells at higher prices, increased from the current w o rl d
price by the percentage of the subsidy.
A Great Power should never grant a subsidy to make more money in the short
run. Howev e r, when com p eting for a market with other Great Pow e rs, you might
find it to your adv a n ta g e to sell at reduced prices if the alt e rn a t i v e is not to sell at
all. When competing with o ther Great P owers for scarce resources, you might find
it better to pay more if the alternative is not getting the resources at all.
In the long run, subsidies establish a dependence of the Minor Nation on y o u r
G reat Pow e r. Each deal that you make with the Minor Nation moves you furt h e r
ahead of the other Great Pow e rs. Ev e n t u a l l y, your status as the fav o u ri t e tra d i n g
p a rtner allows you to control the f o reign trade of the Minor Nation. When t h e
nation becomes your colony, you can set prices at the w o rld market level and buy
and sell all you want.
Boycotts.
A trade boy c ott goes into effect aut o m a t i c a l l y bet ween countries at w a r. If y o u
choose to enter other boy c otts, it has the obvious effect. You r e c e i v e fewer tr a d e
o ffe rs and have fewer potential markets for your goods. The boy c ott button with
the red “X” t h rough the ship r e p resents a boy c ott preventing your own Gr e a t
Power from trading with the country you click on.
Colony Bo ycotts.
Once you own a colony, you may order it to boy c ott countries independently of
your Great P ower. Ho wever, all your colonies must share the same bo ycott policies.
Click on the boy c ott button with the black cross, and then on the country y o u
want your colony or colonies to bo ycott. If you bo ycott the same country with your
Great Power, you see a combined red “X” and black cross boycott indicator. IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 79
--- page 84 ---
Receiving a Diplomatic Of fer.
Diplomatic of fers are a result of o vertures taken by ano ther Great P ower, including
the declaration of war ov e rt u r e. On the Diplomatic Off e rss c reen, you must
choose to accept or reject each offer as pr e s e n t ed. Actions and f a i l u r e to act have
consequences, such as declaration of war and worsening of diplomatic relations.
Offer to Join an Ally on the Attack .
When an ally att a c ks another Great Power and asks you to join, refusal has no
penalties e xcept for the loss of the alliance. Join the war if you want to fight a war ;
otherwise, stay out.
Demand for You to Defend an All y.
You must be cautious in declining these demands. Since your ally is under att a c k,
th e re are substantial penalties for refusal. Of course, when you accept, nor m a l
declaration of war penalties are paid, dampening your relations with the countries
friendly to the Great P ower you declare war on. Ho wever, the penalties for refusal
are more significant in most cases. 
Re p e a te d l y breaking alliances ev e n t u a l l y leads to diplomatic isolation. The only
way to win the game if this happens to your Great Power is conq u e st and milit a ry
dominance of all the other Great Powers. IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 80

Offer to Make Peace.
If you accept this off e r, the war ends be t ween your country and the Great Pow e r
that made the off e r. Since your allies have not necessar i ly re c e i v ed the same off e r,
you may end up breaking your alliances if you agree to a peace treaty.
Offer of an Alliance.
When another Great Power sends an ov e rt u r e for a diplomatic alliance, it is an
o ffer to join with them for mutual defence. It is true that an alliance is basically
defensive, although it has offensive implications.
If you agree to the alliance, you are making a public promise to defend the ot h e r
G reat Power if it is att a c ked by a t h i rd Great Pow e r. You are accepting t h e i r
promise to do the same for you.
Your relations are not adjusted do w nwa rd if you refuse the off e r. You should
p ro b a b l y refuse if y o u’re not par t i c u l a r ly int e re sted in having a war and the ot h e r
c o u n t r y seems more t h re a t ened than you are. This is q u i te like ly the case when
they ask for an alliance; threat is what makes them seek an alliance.
On the other hand, if you feel t h re a t ened, an alliance may dissuade a pot e n t i a l l y
h o stile power from attacking you. N o rm a l l y, most countries do not attack if t h e
military balance is not in their favour.
Offer to Inter vene in a Minor Nation.
An of fer to inter vene in a war on behalf of an attacked Minor Nation is a one-time
chance with that nation. If you decline, you do not ha ve ano ther chance to absorb
that Minor Nation as a colony, ex c e pt in the unlik e ly event that the other Gr e a t
Power’s attack fails and the Minor Nation joins you peacefully later in the game.
The adv a n ta g es of int e rvention are substantial. F i rst, you get the colony
i m m e d i a te l y, or at least what’s left of it after you defend it. The provinces vote f o r
you if your Great Power is nominated by the Council of Gov e rn o r s for vict o ry.
H oweve r, your decision to int e rvene counts as a declaration of war ag a i n st th e
other Great P ower and this makes you the agg ressor. Alliances of the Great P ower
you are declaring war on may react to your declaration. IMPERIALISM: Diplomacy 81

FIGHTING B ATTLES
Battles t a ke place be t ween two turns. After all Great Pow e rs have or d e red th e
m ovement of their troops, the movements and att a c ks ta ke place simult a n e o u s l y.
H oweve r, when or d e rs contradict each ot h e r, such as two battles planned in t h e
same province, one battle must be r e s o lved f i rst. The order for r e s o lving battles
depends on the army initiative rating of the f o rces inv o lved. Not sur p ri s i n g ly, th i s
rating depends on the r e l a t i v e make-up of the army and the e x p e r ience of t h e
a rmy leader, if any. These rules always apply, r e ga rdless of the mode of r e s o lv i n g
the battle.
Example: Ar my Initiative.
If Prussia and It a ly invade a province of Switzerland on the same turn, the two
fo rces trying to move into the same place are com p a red. Since the Italians have
m o re cav a l ry and a superior leader, their f o rce gains initiative over the Pr u s s i a n s .
The battle be t ween the Swiss and the Italians is r e s o lved f i rst with the It a l i a n s
victorious, in this example. 
If the Prussians are allied with or at peace with It a ly, their invasion does not t a ke
place since the province has become Italian. On the other hand, if the Pr u s s i a n s
a re already at war with It a ly, moving second provides an adv a n ta g e. When t h ey
a t tack the Italians, the Italians may already be w e a kened from their battle with
the Swiss.

Tactical Land Battles.
Fighting on a tactical battlefield gives you the best chance for a crushing defeat of
your enemies. This option may be turned off using the Pr e fe rences screen at any
time during your turn. Howev e r, once you enter the tactical battlefield, you are
c o m m i t t ed to fighting t h e re; but you may choose to let your Defence Minist e r
handle the battle for you.
Deployment.
When the battle begins, green dots displayed on the battlefield show where y o u
can deploy your regiments. The next regiment to be deployed appears in t h e
toolbar. You can delegate deployment to your Defence Minister.
Individual Regiment Initiative.
Once both sides have deployed their f o rces, the battle is fought in a sequence of
unit moves based on the initiative rating of the individual units. This means t h a t
s eve ral of your units might act bef o re any of the enemy regiments; or, that t h e
e n e m y fo rces might all act bef o re you can. Gener a l ly, cav a l ry acts bef o re infa n t ry,
and inf a n t ry acts bef o re art i l l e r y. Howev e r, these rules are modified by t h e
experience rating of the regiments and the qualities of the leaders on each side.
Because the order of mo vement and firing on the battlefield is based on initiative,
th e re is no way for you to select your units out of turn. Units must act or not act
when t h ey get the chance. Often it is useful to avoid f i ring during your tur n ,
p re s e r ving that r e g i m e n t ’s fi re as opportunity f i re for an opponent’s move. If t h i s
is done, the unit fires on the first enemy to move within range.IMPERIALISM: Fighting Battles 83

Using the Battlefield.
On the battlefield you see an area of small pips showing the radius of pot e n t i a l
movement of the active unit. If a pip is g reen, it means that no enemy can fire int o
that space pr e s e n t l y and that the active unit can move their without any fear of
immediate damage. A red pip means that enemy units can fire into that space.
As regiments are damaged, their status bars c h a n g e from green to show red and
ye l l ow sections. Red r e p resents actual wounded or killed soldiers. Y e l l ow
re p resents soldiers whose morale has br o ken and who wish to flee from t h e
battlefield.
When a unit ’s bar is all red and/or yello w, the regiment heads off the battlefield as
rapidly as possible. If enemies are too near, the regiment may choose to sur render .
When one of your regiments is selected you f i re by placing the cursor over an

the tar get is in range, and to a red “X” o ver a r eticle if the tar get is out of range. If
your unit has already fired, the cursor changes to an unloaded gun icon

On the Attack .
The best w ay to conduct an attack is concentration of force against a small number
of def e n d e r s. Use light cav a l ry and light inf a n t ry to draw f i re from st a t i o n a r y
d e fe n d e r s, and then move in your heavy f o rces (Heavy Inf a n t ry and Hea v y
Cavalry are best) and destr oy the line of enemies one by one. Use your artillery t o
weaken the better enemy defenders before your best regiments close with them.
Defending your Provinces.
On defence, even though you benefit from entr e n chments, you must fight activ e ly.
Try to hit attacking ar t i l l e r y with light cav a l ry and r e s e rve your ar t i l l e r y to hit t h e
e n e m y gre n a d i e r s and heavy cav a l ry when t h ey get close enough. Be willing to
ret reat and save your men for a count e r- a t t ack unless you are defending your capitol. 
Entrenchments and Forts.
E n t re n c hments are cr e a ted aut o m a t i c a l l y by the g a rrison of a pro v i n c e .
E n t re n c hments provide a 20% reduction in the damage the entr e n ched r e g i m e n t
s u ffe rs. This is r e fl e c t ed on the Regiment Abilities Table by the higher def e n c e
number for entrenched regiments. 
C o n st r ucting f o rts with your Engineer in key provinces also provides a gr e a t
a d va n ta g e on defence. F o rts provide even a gr e a ter reduction in damage. Each
s u c c e s s i v e level of f o rt i f ication provides a 10% reduction over the previous lev e l .
This means that the best f o rt provides a 50% reduction in damage according to
this formula: 
20%(base for entrenchment) + (10% x 3 for three fort levels) = 50% reduction.
A ny regiments you station behind a f o rt wall but not manning the wall (adjacent
to it) are even saf e r. These units cannot be damaged at all ex c e pt by enemy
a rt i l l e r y. Howev e r, only your ar t i l l e r y can re t u rn fi re over the wall from t h e s e
positions, so placing non-ar t i l l e r y units here mer e ly to protect them is a
questionable strategy.
E ve r y fo rt has a g a te th rough which fr i e n d l y units can sortie, ent e ring t h e
b a t t l e f ield. These units can also re t reat from the battlefield into the f o rt using t h e
ga te. Enemy units can never use the g a te. They must use Combat Engineers
and/or artillery to destroy the fort.IMPERIALISM: Fighting Battles 85
--- page 90 ---
Combat Engineering.
Forts can be knocked down by artillery fire, but this takes a long time. The bes t
method is to use your Combat Engineer units to destr oy the forts. To use an
Combat Engineer unit of any era, look for the sho vel cursor next to the position of
the unit on the battlefield when the Combat Engineer unit is active. Clicking on a
space adjacent to the regiment causes it to begin construction of a sapper tunnel.
E a ch active turn for the regiment allows the e x tension of the tunnel one space
f u rth e r. Since the regiment spends most of its time underground or behind prot e c t i v e
c o n st r uction, it is v e ry difficult for the def e n d e r s to do serious harm to the Combat
E n g i n e e r s while t h ey build tow a rd the walls. Howev e r, since only one tile of tunnel
can be cons t ru c t ed each turn, it can be a lengthy process to appr o a ch the f o rt .
Once the engineering unit r e a ches the walls, it conducts a v e ry pow e rful att a c k
a ga i n s t one tile of the f o rt using a dynamite cur s o r. Any unit defending that tile
can make an attack on the Combat Engineer the turn t h ey attack the wall. Once
the fort tile is destr oyed, regiments from bo th sides can mo ve through it freely and
the defensive bonus from that tile is eliminated.
Leaders and Morale.
M o s t regiments flee from battle bef o re th ey are des t royed. Generals are used to
prevent this from occur ring. When a general is the active unit, mo ve him adjacent
to any of your regiments who have suff e red damage, and click on your unit.
Morale is res tored according to the ability of the General. Since this morale boos t
restores some broken troops to action, the firepower of the regiment increases.
Up grading a g e n e r al im p roves his movement r a te, allowing him to r e a ch more
regiments bef o re th ey flee. The amount of morale r e sto red depends on t h e
experience of the General, not his upgrade level.
O ve r use of a General can cause a w e a kened regiment to be killed outright, as it
remains on the battlefield. You should consider letting a br o ken unit re t reat if it is
near death.

TECHNOLOGICAL AD VANCES
As the Indus t rial Revolution pr o gresses, new discov e ries and inventions multiply
rapidl y. These advancements become a vailable on a world-wide basis; they canno t
be ke pt secret. Howev e r, th e re are economic costs for using a new t e ch n o l o g y ; fo r
exa mple, the cost of equipping your e x p e r t fa rm e r s with the new mec h a n i c a l
reaper or the cost of re-training your military to use rifled artillery. 
U s u a l l y, it is impossible to inv e st in ev e ry new t e chnology as it becomes av a i l a b l e
for the f i rst time. Not only must you pick and choose among v a ri o u s
a d vancements, but you must also decide how much of your Great Pow e r’s cash
can go to t e chnology in the f i rst place. You have many uses for money, and not
enough of it, especially at the beginning of the game.
O ften you can aff o rd to wait. T e ch n o l o g y , once available, does not vanish. If y o u
c a n n o t affo rd the co t ton gin in 1818, inv e st in 1830. On the other hand, you may
never need to improve cotton output in your country. 
Receiving a N otice of N ew Technology .
When a new t e chnology f i rst becomes available, you see a st o ry with a large bold
headline in the newspaper titled “New Inv e n t i o n . ” The text of the article giv e s
you an idea of what this invention does so you can decide whether to invest in it.
Your Minis ters might pr ovide additional reminders on a technology if one of them
feels a particular t e chnology is im p o rtant. For ex a mple, the Defence Minist e r
might remind you to invest in the latest military developments.
If you are not sure what new t e chnologies are available, you can always find out
by going to the Technology Investment screen.
Technology Investment Screen.
From the Terrain Map screen, click on the Invest in Technology button in the
top row of the t o o l b a r . This button has a microscope on it. The most
recently a vailable technologies alw ays appear at the top of the list, but you
m ay need to look at sev e ral pages to view all of the t e chnologies as t h e
game progresses.
From this screen, you can look at the t e chnologies you already own, inv e st in new
technologies, and view a detailed history about each technology. 
Investing and Cancelling.
To inv e st, click on a button listing the price of the new t e ch n o l o g y . The butt o n
changes to the wor dPurchasing , and your cash is reduced by the amount shown on
the button. If you c h a n g e your mind about this inv e stment, click on the butt o n
again. The cash is restored to your reserves.
You cannot cancel a purchase of t e chnology once you click the End T u rnb u t ton on

HIS TORICAL SCENARIOS
The Recovery of F rance 1820.
After the wars of Napoleon, and his final defeat in 1 815, France finds itself g reatly
reduced in e x tent and viewed with suspicion by the other Great Pow e rs. Ac ro s s
the channel, Br i tain is already an indus t rial pow e r, the f i rst in the w o rld. In t h e
East, three conser vative empires, of ten acting tog ether, guarantee that F rance can
n ever dominate Europe again. A serious lack of coal precludes, to an e x tent, t h e
rapid industrialisation so successful in Britain.
But France has adv a n ta g es. Her indus t ries are more advanced than any on t h e
continent, and her size and population are gr e a ter than any power ex c e pt dist a n t
Russia. The lack of unity in Ger m a n y and It a ly means that her bor d e rs are
relatively secure.

P russia seeks domination in Ger m a n y, but the other German st a tes look to
Au st ria, whose r e s o u r ces and population are much gr e a ter than those of Pr u s s i a .
To the w e st, France seeks to ensure that no one power dominates a divided
G e rm a n y. Can Prussia fight w a rs aga i n st these appar e n t ly st ro n g er pow e rs? Can
P russia convince the other st a tes of Ger m a n y that their int e re sts lie in the north

Tutorial Using Civilian Units.
Civilian units are built on the I n d u st r ys c reen. T o learn how to build them f o l l ow
the steps in the Industry tutorial. This tutorial tells you how to use civilian units on
the Terrain Map screen, once they have already been built.
All your civilian units follow similar rules but per form dif ferent jobs on the Terrain
M a p s c reen. As you play each turn your available civilian units appear s e l e c te d i n
order, one after another. This is called the unit cycle.
First Turn.
Prospector .
The selected unit is now the Pr o s p e c to r . On the map this unit is surrounded by a
flashing white outline. The same civilian appears in the toolbar.
• Move the cursor around the map within your country. You can see the cursor 
change over different terrain tiles.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 93
CONTENTS
Cotton Gin. Eli Whitney in vented a simple device that r evolutionised cotton g rowing. His cotton gin
spun the cotton through a roller co vered with tee th and the seeds fell a way.
--- page 98 ---
O ver most types of land, including mountains and hills that are alr e a d y
prospected, you see the cursor appear as a g reen ar row. The g reen ar row means if
you click on that spot you will order the unit to move t h e re, but that t h e re is no
work the unit can do. This is called deploying .
• With the Prospector selected click on a forest tile (the g reen ar row cursor should 
be showing) The Pr o s p e c t or deploys to that tile and turns gray, indicating that 
he has acted this turn, but is not performing any work.
Engineer is selected now, but since you actually do have w o rk for your Pr o s p e c to r
you should going to f i rst cancel the Pr o s p e c to r ’s ord e rs and reassign him, bef o re
dealing with the Engineer.
• Place the cursor over the icon of the Pr o s p e c t or until you see a blue q u e stion mark.
• With this question mark showing, click the mouse.
• Read the dialog box that appears, and click on the button Rescind Orders .
This moves the Pr o s p e c t or back to his st a rting point and makes him the select e d
unit again. 
• W i th the Pr o s p e c t or selected again move the cursor over hills and mountains 
until you find an eye cursor.
• Click with the eye cursor showing. The Pr o s p e c t or will move to that location 
and begin looking for minerals. 
You see the unit animate when w o rking, “grayed-out” when inactive. This w o rk
will take the entire turn. Next turn the prospector appears in the unit cycle again.
Engineer .
Now you cycle to the Engineer. Like the Prospector, he has a flashing white outline
and appears in the toolbar indicating he is selected.
The Engineer is capable of building f o rts, ra i l road tr a c k, ports, and depots. This
t u rn, you should build a depot at the end of the r a i l road from the capital city.
Depots and ports are used to gather resources from the tiles around them. Without
a place to collect the r e s o u r ces and make them available for tr a n s p o r t to indus t ry,
the production of a terrain tile cannot be used. 
• W i th the engineer selected, place your cursor on the tile he occupies. Y ou see a 
hammer cursor.
• Click the mouse on that tile with the hammer cursor showing. A dialog appears.
• On the cons t ruction dialog, click on the depot button. The Engineer begins 
constructing a depot. 
The unit becomes animated when working. This unit constructs forts and ports in
the same way, using the same cons t ruction dialog. For building rail, a cursor of
railroad track indicates the spaces he can build in.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 94

Miner .
The next unit in the cycle is the Miner. Miners open new mines, and impr ove older
mines in hills and mountains. They cannot open mines unless the Pr o s p e c t or has
a l ready found minerals t h e re. This turn your miner will im p rove an e x i sting mine
in the space where he now is.
• W i th the Miner selected, place your cursor on the tile he occupies. You see a 
hammer cursor.
• Click on that space with the hammer cursor showing. The Miner begins to  
a n i m a t e. When he is done w o rking the mine will be bigg e r, and will produce 
more iron ore.
Forester.
Next the F o re ster appears in the cycle. This is the f i rst turn the F o re ster has been
available so none of the f o re st production has been im p roved. Although this unit
is capable of im p roving output in any har d wood f o re st, it would be wise to st a rt
i mp r oving a f o re st near a city, port, or depot. Only then will your tr a n s p o r t
network gain the increased timber output immediately.
T h ree tiles north of the capital city you can see a lighthouse icon in the midst of a
l a rge fo re st. This r e p resents a port built earlier in the game, which g a th e r s timber
from its own tile and all six surrounding tiles of forest.
• W i th the f o re ster selected, move your cursor across the f o re st tiles around the 
port. Look for the hammer cursor again.
• Click with the hammer cursor showing. The F o re ster moves to the indicated 
terrain tile and begins working. This is verified by the animation of the Fores ter 
chopping a tree.
Rancher .
Your last civilian is a Rancher. Ranchers impr ove the output of sheep ranches and
cattle r a n ge te rrain. U n fo rt u n a te l y, you have no liv e stock or sheep tiles near y o u r
p o rts, depots, or your capital. The R a n cher can w o rk on the space he is curr e n t ly
standing in, but this won ’t help until a depot or port is built nearb y. Since you don ’t
need e x t ra live stock right now, t h e re is no reason to inv e st in a new port or depot
to pick up this liv e sto c k. Given these f a c to r s, and the absence of sheep f a rms in
your country, it was a mistake construct a Rancher. 
• W i th the R a n cher selected, click on the disband button on the t o o l b a r . This 
button has an icon with a human figure and a line through it.
• On the dialog that appears click OK. The R a n cher vanishes but the w o rker 
used to construct this unit returns to the Industry screen where he came from.
Un l i ke other or d e rs, you cannot rescind the decision to disband a unit, alt h o u g h
you can always rebuild that unit again lat e r. You have now com p l eted the unit
cycle of civilians for this turn.
• Click on End Turn at the bottom of the toolbar.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 95
--- page 100 ---
Second Turn.
This turn, you go t h rough the unit cycle again, but only one unit has finished w o rk.
Prospector .
If the spot you or d e red pr o s p e c t ed last turn had nothing of value you will now see
a pick a xe and a red “X” in the tile near your selected Pr o s p e c to r . If the tile did
include minerals, you see an icon of some minerals in the upper - l e ft corner of t h e
terrain tile.
• Ra ther than using the eye cursor to hunt for the next tile to prospect, click on 
the tiny mountain tile shown on the toolbar under the picture of the Prospector .
• The screen centres on an mountain tile. Click on this tile with the eye 
c u rs o r . This f e a t u r e helps find tiles to prospect when most of the country has 
been searched.
• The rest of your units are still working. Click on End Turn .
Third Turn.
• Continue using the Pr o s p e c t or to look for minerals. You can find un p ro s p e c t ed 
spaces by using the eye cursor or the t o o l b a r . Your other units are still 
performing work assigned on the first turn.
• Click on End Turn .
Fourth Turn.
• Continue using the Prospector to look for minerals.
Engineer .
The Engineer has finished the work of building a depot. In his tile, you see a small
building with two green lights near it. The green lights mean that the depot is
c o n n e c t ed to the tr a n s p o r t net wo r k. If t h e re was a break in your r a i l road tr a c k,
the lights would turn red.
There is nothing to be done by the Engineer in his present location. 
• Using the Green arrow cur s o r, click on the map within one tile of something 
you would like to connect. While deploying the Engineer will accomplish no 
work. Next turn he can work in his new location.
(Suggestion: deploy to the southern part of the country somewhere along the mos t
s o u th e r n ra i l road line you have. From t h e re the Engineer can e x tend the r a i l ro a d
t rack further south tow a rd a distant, and curr e n t ly unconnected, iron ore mine.
The best tile is one tile northwest of the town at the end of the line.)
Your Miner and F o re ster are finished developing their spaces. You see additional
st ru c t u r es built where t h ey we re wo rking, v e rifying that the output in those tiles
has increased.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 96
--- page 101 ---
• Click on spaces with the hammer cursor showing to assign the Miner and the 
Fo re ster to keep w o rking. If you need to find a new tile to w o rk in, click on the 
tiny tiles in the toolbar to centre the map.
• Click on End Turn
Fifth Turn.
• Continue using the Prospector to look for minerals.
• Continue to use the Engineer to connect additional r e s o u r ces to your tr a n s p o r t 
n et wo r k. This turn build r a i l road in a sout h we s t direction tow a rd the co t ton 
p l a n t ation and the unconnected iron mine by clicking with the rail cursor 
adjacent to his present location.

Tutorial Using Military Units.
You can build milit a ry units on the Indus t ry screen. This tut o rial cov e rs mo v i n g
and fighting with land military units.
Your Great P ower of Zimm has decided to strike the Minor Nation of Pram across
your east e rn bor d e r. Although the diplomats came up with a pretext for the w a r,
the best reason for taking o ver Pram is to pr event ano ther P ower from using it as a
staging area for invasion. After all, Pram shares a border with your capital city.
Scouting.
• To scout your enemies prior to your invasion, move your cursor over the small 
tent near the town labelled “Demerest” in Pram
• With a red question mark cursor showing, click near the tent.
You r e c e i v e the best es t i m a t e your off i c e rs can provide on the f o rces in t h a t
province.
Selecting.
Your attack f o rce is located in the province of Sussex. To activ a te and order t h e s e
forces, they must be selected .
• Move the cursor over the small tents near the town in Sussex. Look for a f l a g
and arrow.
• W i th the flag and arrow showing, click on the tents. The g a rrison of t h e
p rovince of Sussex appears in the t o o l b a r , and the tents in Sussex now have a
flashing white outline. This garrison is now selected.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 97
CONTENTS
--- page 102 ---
Marshaling Your Forces.
The entire g a rrison is selected, but you may want to leave some of them behind
when you attack. You can use the toolbar to make these decisions.
• Click on the down pointing arrow near the Light Inf a n t ry regiment shown in
the toolbar. Hot text in the upper-right helps you identify the Light Infantry.
The number “1” between the two ar rows changes to a zero, while the number “1”
under the unit picture remains. Now these numbers are telling you that you s t i l l
have one Light Infantry in the gar rison but that this regiment is no longer selected
to give orders to.
The four regiments in the upper-right corner of the toolbar display ha ve no ar rows
w i th them because t h ey are local militia who cannot be or d e red to leave t h e i r
home province. 
Since these militia remain behind in any event, you should pr o b a b l y attack with
all the rest of your forces.
• Click on the up arrow near the Light Inf a n t ry to r e sto re this regiment to t h e
selected force.
Ordering an Attack .
• W i th the regiments selected, move your cursor over the enemy province of
Demerest. Look for a crossed swords cursor.
This is easier to find if you do not mo ve your mouse directly o ver the t own because
near the town, the scouting cursor appears again.
• Click an y w h e r e in the province with the crossed sw o rds showing to order t h e
attack.
You see a red ar row appear in Demerest. If you had ordered your units to mo ve to
a friendly province, this arrow would be green.
• Click on the red arrow with the blue q u e stion mark cursor showing. A dialog
appears, confirming the forces and their order.
• Click OKto confirm the orders and dismiss the box.
• Click on End Turn at the bottom of the toolbar to advance to the battlefield.
Fighting a Battle: Initiative, Moving, Firing.
Your Defence Minis ter appears and asks you if you want him to deploy the troops. 
• Since this should be a simple victor y, click OK. Otto-Deploy is fas ter than doing it
yourself.
Tactical combat is fought based on initiative. Each regiment acts in an order based
on experience, leaders, and the type of unit. Generally ca valry acts before infantr y
which acts before artillery.
• To move the regiment with initiative click on a dot shown on the battlef i e l d .
Green dots are safe from enemy fire. Red dots are in range of enemy forces.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 98
--- page 103 ---
• To find an enemy in range, mo ve your cursor o ver po tential tar gets. If the tar get
is in range of the unit with initiative, you see a Cross Hairs cursor. If your unit is
out of range, you see a Cross Hairs with a red “X” through it.
• To fire, click on an enemy in range.
M o st units can move and f i re in the same turn. If t h ey do not f i re at an enemy, t h ey
a u to m a t i c a l l y re s e rve their f i re for the f i rst enemy regiment that moves in r a n ge. 
• To end the turn of a unit without moving as far as possible or without f i ring, click
on the done button in the tactical t o o l b a r . This is the middle of the t h ree butt o n s .
• When all the enemy f o rces have surr e n d e r ed or fled, you are no t i fied of y o u r
victory. Click OK to advance the turn.
Fighting a Battle: Losses and Morale.
As regiments are damaged, their status bars c h a n g e from green to show red and
ye l l ow sections. Red r e p resents actual wounded or killed soldiers. Y e l l ow
re p resents soldiers whose morale has br o ken and who wish to flee from t h e
battlefield.
When a unit’s bar is all red and/or y e l l ow the regiment heads off the battlefield as
rapidly as possible. If enemies are too near, the regiment may choose to sur render .
If the bar disappears completely, the regiment has been destroyed.
Battle Reports.
Fighting on the tactical battlefield is an option that may be turned on or off in the
p re fe r ences screen. R e ga r dless of which mode of combat resolution you pr e fe r,
you receive a summary of all the tur n’s battles called a battle report. This turn the
only report is the battle you just fought.
• Click on the lar ge wooden  “i”button to bring up the de tails on all the units who
just fought.
When you fight more than one battle, the arrows allow you to cycle t h rough all
the battle reports for that turn.
New Turn.
You should now allow your f o rces in Demer e st to heal bef o re continuing t h e
attack. Regiments which are not moving heal during their turn.
When t h ey are r e a d y , you can continue to practice your skills ag a i n st Pram, or
sta rt a new game of your own. For a pr o p e r ly balanced game, you should begin
again since many military forces have been added to this tutorial.
Tutorial for Using N aval Units.
For this tut o rial your Great Power possesses one Fr i ga te and two Ships-of-t h e - L i n e .
The Fr i ga te is stationed off the coast of Deneb, while the two other ships are
stationed in home w a te rs. Your country is at war with Deneb.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 99

Selecting.
• Place your cursor over the f l e et just off your coast, until you see a pennant with
an arrow. 
• Click to select this fleet with the pennant and arrow cursor.
Patrolling.
A patrolling fleet attem pts to intercept hostile ships entering or s tationed in the sea
zone of the patrol. The three buttons directly abo ve the fleet in the toolbar control
how aggressive the captains of the patrolling ships will be.
• W i th the f l e et selected, click on the central button, showing two cannon icons,
for normal aggressiveness.
• W i th the f l e et selected, order it to patrol this sea zone by clicking an y w h e r e in
the sea zone with the telescope cursor showing.
The patrolling f l e et appears in the sea zone with a telescope symbol near it
indicating a patrol. Other possible actions are defined by diff e rent cur s o rs and
m a t c hing symbols Fleets can conduct landing missions in hostile t e rri to ry using
the cannon cur s o r; move to a new sea zone with the wheel cursor or block a d e
enemy ports shown by the red “X” ship cursor. 
• Click on the fleet with the blue question mark cursor and read the dialog box.
• Click on OK to confirm the fleet’s patrol orders.
Orders for the F rigate.
• Click on the Mini-map near the y e l l ow country of Deneb. Your Fr i ga te is
stationed on the far side, near Deneb’s capital city
• Click with the pennant and arrow showing to select this fleet.
L i ke the Ships-of-the-Line, the fr i ga te could be or d e red to patrol, but a block a d e
of Deneb’s capital would be more effective.
• Place the cursor over the anchor icon representing the home port of Deneb. 
• Click with the red “X” and ship showing to establish the blockade.
• You have ordered both fleets. Click on End Turn .
It might t a ke more than one turn for your blockading fr i ga te to succeed. When it
does, you receive a report about the interception of enemy mer chants. You receiv e
re p o r ts of naval battles in the same way. Since Deneb has no f l e et right now, y o u
do not have to fight just yet.
• On the battle r e p o r t screen click on the large wooden “ i ”b u t ton to read more
information about a battle or interception.
S o m e times, your blockade mer e ly fo rces the enemy to t a ke their cargo back to por t ,
but if you are more f o rt u n a t e, you may cap t u re or sink their merchant ships as w e l l .
You may continue to practice your naval tactics, but for a balanced game y o u

Tutorial for Using the T ransport Screen.
Your tr a n s p o r t net wo r k is used to move commodities in your country from to w n s
and rural areas to the industrial centre of the capital city. 
• Click on the Go to T r a n s p o r tb u t ton in the t o o l b a r . This button has an icon of a
c ra te with an arrow under it. Hot text in the upper - right of the screen says G i v e
Transport Orders when the cursor is over this button.
In the Tra n s p o r ts c reen, all the possible commodities to tr a n s p o r t appear, but
only the coloured icons are available in your country right now.
• Place your cursor over v a rious icons and read the inf o rmation in the hot text in
the upper-right part of the screen.
The bar with the r a i l road car icon in the low e r- right part of the screen tells y o u
h ow much of you tr a n s p o r t is being used over the total you have. Right now, two
points of your total of twenty-four are not being used.
• Click on the arrow to the right of the coal slider, one click, until the line under
the slider turns green.
A green demand line means that the amount to be tr a n s p o r ted satisfies t h e
demand for that item. A red demand line means that indus t ry or w o rke rs re qu i r e
more of that commodity.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 101

Internal Combustion. Internal combustion replaced the s team engine in industry and then res tored
mobility to the battlefield with the in vention of tanks.
--- page 106 ---
Although all demands are satisfied no w, you still ha ve one more point of transpor t
capacity. 
• Click on the ar row to the right of the timber slider to order the transport of nine
units of timber. Timber is the most critical r e s o u r ce at the beginning of t h e
game (with the exception of food).
It might be the case that e x t ra food is being brought to the w o rke rs under t h e s e
o rd e r s. If so, your tr a n s p o r ted food could be reduced to allow more timber, coal,
or iron to make its way to industry.
• Click on an arrow to the left side of one of the food sliders. The demand line
turns red. This lets you know that your food orders are already set as low as you
can af ford. If a smaller amount of food was transpor ted, the wor kers might ha ve
to eat your reserves of canned food. Eventually workers could starve.
You could check the amounts being tr a n s p o r ted without clicking by reading t h e
hot text to the upper-right when a cursor is over a commodity.
• Click on the arrow in the upper - l e ft part of the screen to re t u rn to the Te rra i n
M a p s c reen. You now know how to use the tr a n s p o r t system. To increase t h e
transport capacity available, build more in the railyard on the Industry screen.
You can continue with this game or start one of your own.
Tutorial For Using the Industry Screen.
• Click on the Go to Industry button marked with a smoking factory icon.
• Mo ve the cursor o ver the screen and watch the hot t ext in the upper-right corner
for the names of the various buildings.
• Open the w a rehouse by clicking on it. The w a rehouse is near the t o p - c e n t r e of
the screen.
The w a rehouse provides a list of the commodities available for your use, divided
i n to production economies. For more inf o rmation see the “Production Economies”
section, st a rting on page 52. 
Giving Orders to Industr y.
• Open the Clothing f a c to r y by clicking on it. This brings up the production 
dialog for the factory.
The left border of the screen pr ovides a summary of the labour (wor kers) presentl y
in the city, in the same way that the w a rehouse shows available commodities. As
you give or d e rs to indus t ry, these numbers go down as labour is assigned to w o rk
and commodities are used up by the factory.
The clothing f a c to r y has a capacity of one. That means you can make one unit of
c l othing per turn. The six f a c to r ies and mills in the lower part of the screen all
h ave limited capacity. All of them r e qu i r e labour and commodities from y o u r
stockpile to produce anything.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 102
CONTENTS
--- page 107 ---
• Click on the arrow to the right of the slider on the clothing factory dialog. 
As you do this, the amount of available labour shown in the right border under
the arm icon goes down by two, and the amount of fabric shown at the centre-top
of the warehouse also goes down by two.
The equation on the clo thing factory dialog tells you why this happens. Every time
you order a new unit of clothing you expend two units of f a b ric and use (for t h i s
turn) two units of labour.
Note that the numbers under each w o rker type in the left border did not c h a n g e
when you made the clothing. These w o rke rs are your permanent w o rk fo rce and
their numbers decrease only when w o rke rs leave indus t ry per m a n e n t l y. The
number under the arm icon shows how much of the labour of these w o rke rs
remains available this turn.
• Click on some other indus t ries in the lower section of the screen and give t h e m
production orders as well. 
Some of these indus t ries cannot make an y thing because your w a rehouse lacks t h e
commodities they require. This is shown by a red “X” near the item you are shor t
of. You may choose to lea ve these dialogs open, or close them af ter you ha ve given
your orders. 
• To close, click on the box in the upper-left of each dialog on a Mac, upper-right 
in Windows ‘95. 
The Food Processing Centre at the upper - l e ft of the screen and the R a i lya rd near
the upper-right function just like one of these factories or mills, e xcept that there is
no limit of capacity. This means you can produce as much canned food (out of r aw
foods) or tr a n s p o r t capacity (out of lumber and steel) as you wish, as long as y o u
have labour and the required commodities available.
Increasing Capacity .
One clothing per turn is not v e ry much. You could make more money by
producing two per turn.
• Click on the Clothing F a c to r y to open the production dialog unless it’s alr e a d y
open on the screen.
• Click on the brass button with the two factories in the upper-right of the dialog.
This brings up the Clothing Factory Expander.
The Expander tells you the cost of the expansion and what the capacity the factor y
is when the expansion is completed.
• Click the OK button on the Expander to order the increased capacity. S teel and
Lumber are deducted from the w a rehouse at this moment. Expansion r e qu i re s
no labour.
Note scaf folding around your clo thing factory and a hammer and nail icon on the
p roduction dialog. Both of these indicate the expansion is occurring this turn. It
will be completed next turn.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 103
--- page 108 ---
Building a Unit.
You need ships, civilians, and regiments to expand your Em p i re. Three buildings
on this screen, the Shipy a rd, the U n i ve rs i t y , and the Ar m o u r y, cons t ruct t h e s e
different unit types. This turn, build a Miner.
• Click on the University to open the university dialog
• Click on the Button with a picture of a Miner to recruit the Miner. 
• If you are not sure which unit is the Miner, click on each button until you see
the inf o rmation titled “Miner” in the panel to the right side of the dialog.
Clicking on the buttons does not order the unit to be built.
• To build a Miner, click on the right ar row under the Miner button. The number
“1” appears under the picture letting you know you ha ve ordered one Miner. In
the border to the left of the screen, the expert wor ker used to build the Miner is
a c t u a l l y deducted from your w o rk fo rce per m a n e n t l y, so the icon r e p re s e n t i n g
that worker disappears. 
Next turn, the Miner appears on the Terrain Map.
The Ar m o u r y and the Shipy a rd both w o rk exa c t ly like the U n i ve rs i t y , alth o u g h
building ships does not require workers, just materials.
Training Labour .
To replace the labour of w o rke rs per m a n e n t l y deducted from Indus t ry you can
improve the training level of your work force. 
• Click on the Trade School to open the Trade School dialog
• Make sure you have at least one labour still available. If you do not, open a
p roduction dialog and reduce production. You must have at least one labour
free to train.
• Click on the ar row to the right of the top slider. This takes one untrained wor ker
and orders it to be educated up to le vel of trained wor ker this turn. The wor kers
cannot work in a factory while being educated.
E a ch level of training doubles the amount of labour perf o rmed. An untr a i n e d
wo rker adds one point of labour to your total. A trained w o rker adds two points.
The mighty expert worker adds four points of labour.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 104
--- page 109 ---
Mig ration.
Even with training you need to increase population to keep your economy rolling.
Using the Capitol Building you can recruit more untrained workers for Industry.
• Click on the Capitol building to bring up the Migration dialog. 
• Click on the arrow to the right of the slider to bring migrant w o rke rs to y o u r
city by expending food, clothing and fur n i t u r e to im p rove their st a n d a r d 
of living.
The amount of new w o rke rs that can migr a te to indus t ry each turn is limited by
the size of your country. Remember that each new w o rker must have food to eat
every turn.
You have now learned the basics of Industry in I MPERIALISM .
• Click on the arrow in the upper-left to return to the T errain Map screen. 
• Click on End T u rnon the Te rrain Map s c reen to advance to the next turn and
check the results of your production and unit building orders. You can continue

Tutorial For Using the Diplomacy Screen.
First Turn.
• From the Terrain Map screen, click on the Go to Diplomacy button. It has an icon
of a diplomat’s top hat on it. Hot text in the upper - right also helps you identify
this button.
Obtaining Information.
When you decide to make a nation a frequent trading partner and to impr ove your
relations with that nation, it is called “cour t i n g . ” Your long-t e rm goal when
c o u r ting is to gain control of the nation peacefully. It is unwise to court nations
w h i c h you plan to conquer milit a ri ly any way, since the assets you spend cour t i n g
that country are then wasted.
Your Great Power does not have enough cash, trade goods, or merchant mar i n e
to court all the Minor Nations in the world so your fir st step is to de termine whic h
nations to court.
• To obtain information about the products produced in the Minor Nations, click
on the small green circle with a white ship in the low e r- c e n t r e of the scr e e n .
Then click on any Minor Nation on the map. This selects that nation and causes
it to be outlined in white. You see on the lo wer-right part of the screen the major
exports of the selected nation.
• Click on v a rious Minor Nations on the map, observing what commodities t h ey
a re like ly to e x p o r t. Your Great Power is short on coal and iron, so pay special
attention to nations who sell those resources.
• Click on the o ther Great P owers and see which Minor Nations are already being
cour ted by o ther Great P owers. If the o ther po wers es tablish trade consulates in
a Minor Nation, it means that they intend to court those nations.
• Click on the icon dir e c t ly above the green circle. This displays the level of
f riendliness (relationships) of all the countries in the game. You use this to see
which Minor Nations are friendly to those nations you plan to trade with. 
A l though many Minor Nations sell one or both of coal and iron, the best ones to
court are Issa and Zinlu. This is true because of the following factors:
1. Your neighbour Loke is a poor nation which is not wor th trading with but whic h
you will need to conquer later in the game if only for security reasons. Issa and
Zinlu are not especially fr i e n d l y with Loke. You should court countries that are
not friendly with lands you plan to in vade, since your in vasion hurts relations wit h
everyone friendly with the nation(s) you invade.
2. Zinlu and Issa are friendly to each other
3. Neither nation has a land border with o ther Great P owers. This means they ar e
unlikely to be invaded right away.
4. Zinlu, at least, is not being courted by any other Great Power.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 108

Taking Actions.
Once you have decided which nations to court, you use, for the f i rst time, the large
tabs on the low e r- right of the screen. This turn you should use the Offer Treaties ta b .
• Click on the Offer Treaties tab.
• Click on and select the scroll labelled Trade Consulate .
• Click on Issa and Zinlu on the map. You see a y e l l ow scroll icon appear wit h i n
the bor d e rs of those nations conf i rming you have paid for the cons t ruction of a
trade consulate in those nations. This is the fir st step in courting Issa and Zinlu.
• Click on the arrow in the upper - l e ft of the screen to re t u rn to the Te rrain Map
s c reen. You have finished your diplomacy for this turn. You may end your turn
n ow, or t a ke actions on other screens bef o re ending your turn. The End T u rn
button is on the lower-right of the Terrain Map screen.
Second Turn.
Obtaining Information.
• From the Terrain Map screen, click on the Go to Diplomacy button. 
• W i th your own Great Power selected and outlined in white, click on the scr o l l
icon in the low e r- c e n t r e of the screen. You see a small dollar sign icon in Issa
and Zinlu confirming that you now have trade consulates there.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 109
Dynamite. Although dynamite has many military applications, mining and construction also benefited
from this explosive in vented in 1866.

• Click on the small g reen circle icon in the lo wer-centre of the screen. Then click
on v a rious Great Pow e rs. You are checking to see if any of your com p et i to r s
have taken more “courting” actions in Issa or Zinlu.
Notice that when P a tagon and Kem are selected, t h e re is a green circle labelled
5% within the bor d e rs of Issa. This means that your com p et i to r s have off e red Issa
a 5% trade subsidy in hopes of im p roving their chances at Issa’s r e s o u r ces and
markets. No competitors have offered Zinlu a subsidy.
Take actions.
• Click on the large green circle tab in the low e r- right of the screen. This t a ke s
you to the trade policies screen. Here you offer subsidies to com p ete fo r
resources and markets with your foes.
• Click on the g reen button labelled 5% then click on Zinlu on the map. You see a
green icon appear inf o rming you that you off e red Zinlu a 5% trade subsidy.
Since no other Great Pow e rs are courting Zinlu right now this should put y o u
ahead in the race for Zinlu’s resources and markets.
• Click on the green button labelled 10%, then click on Issa. By off e ring Issa a
l a rger subsidy than those off e red by Kem and P a tagon, you hope to move into
first place as Issa’s favourite trading partner.
• Click on the arrow in the upper - l e ft of the screen to re t u rn to the Te rrain Map
screen. 
You are finished with the Diplomacy Tutorial. The next s tep is to open Embassies
in the nations you plan to court. This costs $5000. You should also seek to tr a d e
frequently with Issa and Zinlu to improve relations as rapidly as possible. 
You may continue this game, or start one of your own.IMPERIALISM: Tutorial Walk Through 110

STRATEGY IDEAS
A game of I M P E R I A L I S M tends to ev o lve in t h ree phases, which can be t e rm e d
D evelopment, Diplomacy, and Des t ruction. The emphasis is diff e rent for each phase.
Tips For the Development Phase.
At the beginning of the game, your gr e a te s t lack is money. Early development of
reliable income sources gets you off to a f a st sta rt. This is best done by f i n d i n g
Minor Nations which produce r e s o u r ces you are short of, and trading with t h e m
eve ry turn. Using trade consulates and subsidies you can guar a n tee these Minor
Nations want to purchase your goods ahead of those of the other Great Pow e rs .
Do not spread your eff o rts be t ween too many diff e rent Minor Nations. This oft e n
causes you to fall behind in all of them, losing the battle for markets.
Wi th consistent income from the sale of goods, you purchase new t e ch n o l o g i e s ,
build new civilian units, and cons t ruct lots of rail depots and ports. While you are
looking for gold, coal and iron, consider building a depot or port with plentiful
timber immediat e ly. Timber dr i ves your early development even more than do
coal and iron because timber is r e qu i r ed to produce both paper and lumber.
G e n e ra l l y, the bigg e st re st rictions on early development result from deciding
between: 1) training and new units (paper); 2) the need for transport and industrial
capacity (lumber along with steel); and, 3) the need for w o rker migration to
i n d u st r y (fur n i t u r e, along with canned food and clothing). Timber is the only
resource required for all three.
On the indus t ry screen, you must s t ri ve to maintain a balance be t ween labour,
i n d u st r ial capacity, and raw r e s o u r ces available to indus t ry (th rough either tr a d e
or tr a n s p o r t). When one of these items shows a surplus, w o rk on increasing t h e
oth e rs to maintain rough eq u a l i t y . At the beginning of the game your short a ge is
l i ke ly to be labour. Often an early increase to the size of the lumber mill f o ste rs
rapid development.
The most im p o rtant t e chnologies early in the game are the iron r a i l road br i d ge which
a l l ows the doubling of timber output, and sq u a re - s e t timbering which allows t h e
doubling of mineral outputs. These should be purchased as soon as t h ey are available. 
If you want to fight a war during this period, a single frigate can do a g reat deal of
damage as a privateer before the other Great Powers build their navies. IMPERIALISM: Strategy Ideas 112

Tips For the Diplomacy Phase.
G ra d u a l l y your int e rnal production and indus t rial outputs provide surpluses and
p e rmit you to focus on other nations as well as your own. For Minor Nations t h i s
means obtaining colonies, either by defending them from agg ression of o ther g reat
Powers, or by diplomatic and development actions.
The f i rst step is inv e sting in Embassies with those few Minor Nations you have a
good chance to win to your side. Always f o l l ow an embassy with a non-aggr e s s i o n
pact. Next, send in your Pr o s p e c to r , your Dev e l o p e r , and other civilian units. By
i n c reasing the output of the Minor nation, you increase the trades you can make
w i th them each turn. This speeds the im p rovement in your relationships. While
this is happening, you need to g reatly augment your mer chant marine to deal wit h
the increasing volume of trade.
G rants (or bribes) serve to help you maintain a lead over other Great Pow e rs, but
it is g e n e ra l l y be t ter to use the money for development f i rst, and only make
significant g rants if you ha ve a subs tantial surplus. Although g rants to o ther Great
Powe rs do reduce the risk of w a rs, it is g e n e ra l l y a be t ter idea to provide grants to
Minor Nations first.
D u ring this period of the game you must be cautious in st a rting w a rs due to t h e
h a rm your relationships suffer when you declare w a r. Fighting def e n s i ve l y can be
a great benefit howev e r. One good s t ra tegy for early w a rs is to stockpile a large
number of arms and then when you can upgrade your f o rces to do so all at once
using your large stockpile. St a rting a war bef o re your enemies have upgr a d e d
provides a significant edge.
Tips For the Destruction Phase.
When all or nearly all of the Minor Nations have been conq u e red or colonised
you should change your aims to destruction of your foes. This does not necessaril y
mean st a rting a w a r; but it means that you must be pr e p a r ed for more dir e c t
c o n f ro n t ations. Building a large stockpile or arms, inv e sting in a modern na v y,
and upgrading your land forces whenever possible are keys.
Notice which r e s o u r ces you are short on, and protect your sources of those it e m s .
Try to expand ag a i n st a w e a ker power f i rst, and make sure that no one Gr e a t
Power commands a large lead in the Council of Governors.
If you follow these rules successfully, your chances for eventual victory are good.IMPERIALISM: Strategy Ideas 113
